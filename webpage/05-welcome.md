Hello and welcome to CSE131 for fall 2019!   We’re the co-instructors of the course, Professors Doug Shook and Bill Siever, and we’re excited to have the opportunity to introduce you to computer science!  

Below are important details concerning the course.  Items in bold indicate actions you may need to take prior to class!
* <b>We’ll host pre-class introduction meetings on August 25th</b> (the Sunday before classes begin). We do not take attendance but it’s <b>very important you attend</b>. This is an opportunity for us to: meet, discuss the details of the class, and give you a chance to ask questions.  Some of the information we provide is <b>crucial to your performance</b> in this course    Since we can’t all fit in one room, we’ll host two sessions:  
	* If your student ID is an odd number, attend Wrighton Hall Room 300 (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ArZzXr3fmqtdEPAN9">here</a>) from 7-8PM.
	* If your student ID is an even number, attend Wrighton Hall Room 300 (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ArZzXr3fmqtdEPAN9">here</a>) from 8-9PM.
	* If you have a time conflict for your designated session you’re welcome to attend the other session.
* We use a learning management system called Canvas. You’ll be using Canvas to access materials for the course (videos, assignments, etc.) and to see your grades via its gradebook.  
	* The Canvas site is: <a href="https://wustl.instructure.com/courses/24032">https://wustl.instructure.com/courses/24032</a>.  <b>Please verify that you can see course content</b>. (If you need to login, use your your WUSTL key and password.  Your WUSTL key is something you chose as your email name and is also used to log into WebSTAC.  Your WUSTL key is NOT the 4xxxxx numeric ID on your ID card) 
	* Here’s an <a href="https://wustl.box.com/s/qv8pmqjw2bwdjqq3xjl7ugwkqqo05yjs">overview video</a> of how you may want to use Canvas to navigate through the course content.
* There are three exams scheduled for this course, and you can find the dates on Canvas, but they appear below as well.  <b>Mark these down on your calendar because we do not give any make-up exams</b>.  You do get to drop the lowest of your 4 exam scores.
	* Sep 26, 6:30 to 8:30 PM
	* Nov 7, 6:30 to 8:30 PM
	* Dec 5, 6:30 to 8:30 PM
	* Dec 10 (final), 1 to 3 PM
* The scheduling of the final exam on Dec 10 is the second day of the reading period.  It was not our desire to have the exam then, but the university was unable to give us any exam slot that was conflict-free with courses our students are taking.
* We will be using Piazza as our course forum, which will allow you to ask questions, answer questions from other students, and see receive announcements regarding the course. <b>When you get an email invitation to the Piazza forum, please accept it (or click <a href="http://piazza.com/wustl/fall2019/cse131cse501n">here</a> and enroll yourself).</b>   We will expect you to be regular participants in the forum:  Check it regularly for updates from instructors about the course, review the questions that have already been asked (and any answers) regularly, etc.
* <b>We want to offer you the opportunity to do Module 0 and Lab 0 before our first class.</b> You are not obligated to do this, but most students appreciate getting this done so they can breeze through the first meeting. 
	* Like all our modules, Module 0 has videos you watch. Go to the course website and watch the videos in sections 0.0 - 0.5 (6 short videos and approximately 18 minutes in total).
	* Modules also have Studios and Labs
	* All required software is already installed in the CSE computer labs, but most students prefer working on their own computer, in which case they need to install Java, IntelliJ, and load your repository (which is used to distribute and collect assignments).  (If you’re a student in the school of engineering and don’t have a laptop, contact the instructors. The school as a small number of machines available for students)


* Like most courses at Washington University, our course has an academic integrity policy, which prescribes how you are allowed to collaborate, and what happens if you break those rules.  This policy, and all others, can be found by clicking the Policies link in the left navigation column on our course website.

	Academic integrity in computer science courses has been a topic receiving a great deal of attention, at Washington University but also at universities such as Harvard and Stanford.  We really want you to learn this material and we are committed to working with you as you need help.   Sadly, many students are caught cheating in this (and other computer science courses, here and elsewhere), because the tools we have for finding derivative code are very good.  Here are the reasons you should not cheat:
	* It is almost certain you will be caught.  The evidence that catches you is quite strong and holds up in hearings.  If you are clever enough to avoid getting caught, you should be clever enough to do the work in the first place.
	* The repercussions of getting caught are far worse than not turning in the assignment at all.  They include a permanent notation on your record and a grade sanction for your final grade in the course.  For some students this can lead to suspension or even expulsion.
	* The instructors and TAs are here to help you.  We know that other courses and activities take up your time, and you may wait until the last minute. It is far better to get a zero on the assignment than to be caught cheating.

	We will be announcing mechanisms before and during the semester to try to reduce the number of academic integrity violations to ZERO.  We are committed to seeing this happen but we need your help.    

We emphasize again that doing Lab 0 ahead of time is optional, but encourage you to give a try, and then count on us to help you the first Tuesday during lab time.

We look forward to having you in class,

Doug & Bill
