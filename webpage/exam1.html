	<b>Please Note:</b> This is a coding exam that we expect you to take on a computer. You will need to bring your laptop and be prepared to use Eclipse to code and test your answers before submitting them. If you do not have access to a laptop you can take the exam in the lab, please see below for details.
	<br><br>
	It is strongly encouraged that you attend the class sessions on Thursday. The TAs will be going over exam materials and talking about what you should see in your repository in advance of the exam. You can also fix any repository issues that you may have prior to taking the exam.
	<br><br>
	It should be noted that if you do have a technical problem with Eclipse or your repository during the exam, we will help you, but you will NOT be given extra time. It is extremely important that you correct these issues ahead of time so that you do not have to use exam time to fix any problems.
	
	
	<h2>Date and Time</h2>
	The exam will be from 6:30PM to 8:30PM on Monday, February 13th.
	
	<h2>Location</h2>
	The exam will be held in the following rooms. Use the chart to determine what room you should go to:

	<br><br>
	Please bring a laptop. You will need to complete all of your work on your own computer and then commit and push your work to your repository, just like you would for a homework assignment. Please make sure your repository is in working order <b>before</b> showing up to the exam.
	<br><br>
	You are allowed to use Eclipse and anything that you may have in Eclipse, but you are not allowed to use any other electronic devices (such as a phone) and you are not allowed to access the internet for any reason except for committing and pushing your work. If we see that you have a browser open during the exam you will be considered in violation of the academic dishonesty policy.
	<br><br>
	<h2>Studying for the Exam</h2>
	You can find practice exams <a href="/cse131/exam1.pdf">here</a> and <a href="/cse131/exam1_fall16.pdf">here</a>. Please note that the format of the exam you will take is significantly different than the format of these exams. You will be taking your exam on a computer, whereas these exams did not allow the use of electronic devices. The questions one these exams are still representative of the types of questions that will be on your exam. In general, you should focus on studying course concepts, **not** the format - if you understand the concepts well then the format of the exam should not matter.
	<br><br>
	The TAs will be leading a review session in class on Thursday, February 9th. There is also a recitation session on February 8th from 1-2:30 in Brown 100 that will be focused on review for the exam.

	<h2>Make Up Exam</h2>
	There is a make up exam scheduled for Thursday, February 16th from 6-8PM in Jolley 309. If you are unable to attend the exam at the scheduled place and time <u>you must notify the instructors</u>. If you show up to the make up exam without notifying us ahead of time, you will not be allowed to take the exam.
