# Warmup

* First, form a group of two people (or three if absolutely needed). You can access the repository for your group <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/KIhZixS_" target="_blank">here</a>. One member of your group will create the group then the rest of your group should use the same link to join your group.   <br/><br/>When importing the project be sure to:
  1. Close all projects (in every open IntelliJ window pick `File > Close Project`)
  2. Once you get back to the initial IntelliJ window (small square box):<br/>![IntelliJ Start Window](../../../assignments/IntelliJStartWindow.png){:width="50%"} <br/>select the `Check out from Version Control` option.
  3. Use the repo URL
  4. As you step through the import process **give each window a second to search for the required resources**.
* All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work
* Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
* Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard.

## Videos To Watch
You should have already watched these videos in preparation for the studio, but they are repeated here for your reference.

## Before you begin

When you load up the repository, you'll notice that there are some errors in the `UniversityDatabaseTest.java` file. This test relies on your implementation of the `Student` class from lab 7. Copy the code from your `Student` class into the `Student.java` file in the `studio9` package and make sure the errors are resolved before proceeding.

## Map Name to Height Warmup
<OL>
<LI>Open the Java file NameToHeight in the studio9 package and edit the main method.</LI>
<LI>Create a new instance of a Map from key type String to value type Integer.<br>Note: <A HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</A> is an interface so you will need to create an instance of a <A HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">class which implements it</A>.</LI>
<LI>Associate each member of your team's name with their height (use inches or centimeters at your preference).</LI>
<LI>Repeatedly prompt the user (via ArgsProcessor) for a name.</LI>
<UL>
<LI>If the users cancels (argsProcessor will return null) then break.</LI>
<LI>Otherwise, look up the name in the map for the associated height.<BR>Be sure to handle the null case for names that are not in the map.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>

Explain your solution to your TA before moving on.

## Word Count
This section of the studio can be tested with <KBD>WordCountTest</KBD> in the <KBD>studio9.tests</KBD> package.
<OL>
<LI>Open the Java file WordCount in the studio9 package.</LI>
<LI>Implement the countWords(words) method to meet this specification:</LI></OL>
```
/**
 * Constructs and returns a map of the distinct words in the specified list with
 * each word associated with its accumulated count (that is: the number of
 * occurrences of the word in the list).
 * 
 * For example, if passed a List<String> containing:
 * 
 * [to, be, or, not, to, be]
 * 
 * the resulting Map<String,Integer> would contain
 * 
 * key="to", value=2; 
 * key="be", value=2; 
 * key="or", value=1; 
 * key="not", value=1;
 * 
 * @param words
 * @return a map which contains all of the distinct words as keys, each
 *         associated with the number of occurrences of the word
 */
```

Ensure that <KBD>WordCountTest</KBD> is working and you have explained your solution to your TA before moving on.

## University Database
This section of the studio can be tested with <KBD>UniversityDatabaseTest</KBD> in the <KBD>studio9.tests</KBD> package.
<OL>
<LI>Create a new class <KBD>UniversityDatabase</KBD> in the studio9 package.</LI>
<LI>Declare a single private final instance variable of type Map&lt;String, Student&gt;.</LI>
<LI>Implement the default constructor to initialize the map instance variable.</LI>
<LI>Implement <KBD>public void addStudent(String accountName, Student student)</KBD> which associates with the key accountName the value student in the map.</LI>
<LI>Implement <KBD>public int getStudentCount()</KBD></LI>
<LI>Implement <KBD>public String lookupFullName(String accountName)</KBD> by looking up the student and then using the getFullName() method on Student.  If the student is null, you should return null as the full name.</LI>
<LI>Implement <KBD>public double getTotalBearBucks()</KBD> via iterating over the map.</LI>
</OL>

Ensure that <KBD>UniversityDatabaseTest</KBD> is working and you have explained your solution to your TA before moving on.
