# Warmup

* First, form a group of two people (or three if absolutely needed). You can access the repository for your group <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/KIhZixS_" target="_blank">here</a>. One member of your group will create the group then the rest of your group should use the same link to join your group.   <br/><br/>When importing the project be sure to:
  1. Close all projects (in every open IntelliJ window pick `File > Close Project`)
  2. Once you get back to the initial IntelliJ window (small square box):<br/>![IntelliJ Start Window](../../../assignments/IntelliJStartWindow.png){:width="50%"} <br/>select the `Check out from Version Control` option.
  3. Use the repo URL
  4. As you step through the import process **give each window a second to search for the required resources**.
* All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work
* Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
* Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard.

## Videos To Watch
You should have already watched these videos in preparation for the studio, but they are repeated here for your reference.

## Before you begin

When you load up the repository, you'll notice that there are some errors in the `UniversityDatabaseTest.java` file. This test relies on your implementation of the `Student` class from lab 7. Copy the code from your `Student` class into the `Student.java` file in the `studio9` package and make sure the errors are resolved before proceeding.

You may use which ever implementation you feel is best.

## Map Name to Height Warmup

1. Open the Java file NameToHeight in the studio9 package and edit the main method.
2. Create a new instance of a Map from key type String to value type Integer.<br>Note: <A HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</A> is an interface so you will need to create an instance of a <A HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">class which implements it</A>.<
3. Associate each member of your team's name with their height (use inches or centimeters at your preference).
4. Repeatedly prompt the user (via ArgsProcessor) for a name.
   If the users cancels by hitting the cancel button (`ArgsProcessor` will return a `null`) then stop prompting for more names.
   Otherwise, look up the name in the map for the associated height.  Print out both the name and the height.<BR>Be sure to handle the `null` case for names that are not in the map and print an appropriate message.


Explain your solution to your TA before moving on.

## Word Count
This section of the studio can be tested with `WordCountTest` in the `studio9.tests` package.

1. Open the Java file WordCount in the studio9 package.
2. Implement the countWords(words) method to meet this specification:
   
~~~
/**
* Constructs and returns a map of the distinct words in the specified list with
* each word associated with its accumulated count (that is: the number of
* occurrences of the word in the list).
* 
* For example, if passed a List<String> containing:
* 
* [to, be, or, not, to, be]
* 
* the resulting Map<String,Integer> would contain
* 
* key="to", value=2; 
* key="be", value=2; 
* key="or", value=1; 
* key="not", value=1;
* 
* @param words
* @return a map which contains all of the distinct words as keys, each
*         associated with the number of occurrences of the word
*/
~~~

Ensure that `WordCountTest` is working and you have explained your solution to your TA before moving on.

## University Database
This section of the studio can be tested with `UniversityDatabaseTest` in the `studio9.tests` package.

1. Open `UniversityDatabase` in the `studio9` package.
2. Declare a single `private final` instance variable of type `Map<String, Student>`.
   * You'll need to import that `Map` interface (`java.util.Map`).
3. Implement the default constructor  (`UniversityDatabase()`) to initialize the map instance variable.
4. Implement `public void addStudent(String accountName, Student student)` which associates with the key `accountName` the value `student` in the map.
5. Implement `public int getStudentCount()`
6. Implement `public String lookupFullName(String accountName)` by looking up the student and then using the `getFullName()` method on `Student`.  If the student is `null`, you should return `null` as the full name.
7. Implement `public double getTotalBearBucks()` via iterating over the map.

Ensure that `UniversityDatabaseTest` is working and you have explained your solution to your TA before moving on.
