# Warmup
* First, form a group of two people (or three if absolutely needed). You can access the repository for your group <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/CuBdaFGU" target="_blank">here</a>. One member of your group will create the group then the rest of your group should use the same link to join your group.   <br/><br/>When importing the project be sure to:
  1. Close all projects (in every open IntelliJ window pick `File > Close Project`)
  2. Once you get back to the initial IntelliJ window (small square box):<br/>![IntelliJ Start Window](../../../assignments/IntelliJStartWindow.png){:width="50%"} <br/>select the `Check out from Version Control` option.
  3. Use the repo URL
  4. As you step through the import process **give each window a second to search for the required resources**.
* All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work
* Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
* Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard. 

# Overview

In this studio you will explore the following two concepts:

* **Writing** methods that do interesting work.
* **Testing** methods to develop assurance that the methods do what was expected.

If necessary review the videos and material concerning methods before proceeding.

> **Important!** Today you must rotate who is doing the typing as you move from one method to the next.  Every person in your group must have a chance to be the <I>lead</I> person at the keyboard for at least one method described below.
>
> All group members are encouraged to help the lead person at the keyboard.

In preparation for the exercises open the following files, found in the **studio5** source folder of your repository:

* `Methods` is a file in which you will type the methods described below.
* There are several separate files that will be used to test each method using a library called [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/){:target="_blank"}: `DistanceBetweenTests.java`, `ArraySumTests.java`, `FilledArrayTests.java`, `ArrayMeanTests.java`, and `BullsEyeTests.java`

# Methods

In the work you see below you should be asking yourselves the following as you write code:

* What is the name of the method?  If you have to create a method and you pick a name that doesn't match the name being used in tests, the tests won't be able to run.  Every character of names must match. The name `Sum` is a different method to Java than the method named `sum`.
  * Names should be descriptive.  It's best if the name a high-level idea of what the method does. Someone who reads where the method is being used should be able to make a reasonable guess about what it will do.  For example, you can probably guess what `double v = Math.sqrt(2)` is doing based on the method's name.
* What are the types of the input parameters and what order are they in? These must also agree with how the method is being used.
* What is the type of the return value, if any?  This must also agree with how the method is being used.

# A function-like method: `distanceBetween()`

Review the `distanceBetween` method in `Methods.java`. This method is a lot like a function from mathematics (the term "function" is often used for methods like this). It will be provided with four arguments and it will perform a computation to generate a result (compute a distance).

It's mostly done for you. (*Don't change it yet*) Read the description and make sure you understand the choices for:

* The name.  Will someone be able to determine what the method does purely from the name?
* The return type.  Why is `double` a good choice here?
* The parameters.  Why are there 4 parameters?  Do the types of each (`double`s) make sense?
* Imagine a program will often need to compute distance between different points.  Can use of this function make code easier to read or avoid duplicating code?  

## Running Tests

Open `DistanceBetweenTests.java`. This file contains several tests to help demonstrate that `distanceBetween()` works as expected.  You can run all the tests in the file by clicking the "play" button next to the class declaration <br/>![DistanceBetweenTests](../../../studios/distanceBetweenTests.png) <br/>

Run it.  You should see a new pane in IntelliJ that should look something like: <br/>![distanceBetween Results](../../../studios/distanceBetweenResults.png) <br/>

* The Yellow Xs indicate test cases that failed.  You can click on them to be taken to the code that failed.
* The Green checks indicate test cases that passed.  *Notice that even incomplete code can sometimes pass tests!*

## Finishing the Code

Complete the code for `distanceBetween()`.  Use other methods, like [`Math.sqrt()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#sqrt(double)){:target="_blank"}, [`Math.pow()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#pow(double,%20double)){:target="_blank"}, and [`Math.abs()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#abs(double)){:target="_blank"}.  (By the way, click on those links and note the format of each of the descriptions.  This style is called JavaDoc.  You'll see it again soon)

## Finishing Testing

Re-run the test cases. Do they all pass?  Probably not!

* In this case one of the test cases itself is flawed.
* Open `DistanceBetweenTests.java` and review `testDistanceBetweenSamePoints()`, which works correctly.  Discuss among your group and a TA how you think the test works.
* If more than one test is failing review your code and update it.  Make sure you're using the correct formula for Euclidean distance.
* Once only one test case fails, double click on the name of the test that's still failing (still yellow).  This is most likely the flawed test case. Review the test case carefully, fix the flaw, and re-run the test cases.

## Adding another test

Once all test pass, add one more test named `testDistance5()` that will verify that the distance between (8,9) and (5,5) is 5.0.

# Array's as parameters: `arraySum()`

> **If working with a partner change who is at the keyboard**

Arrays can be given as parameters to methods. Review the code for `arraySum()` in  `Methods.java`.  As before, pay attention to the JavaDoc comment, return type, parameter types, and name.  Do they all seem to be reasonable choices?

## Finishing the Code

Complete the code for `arraySum()`.

## Testing

Open `ArraySumTests.java` and run the tests.  

Review the tests:

* Figure out how they work (they are slightly different than the tests for `distanceBetween()`).
* Often the goal of testing is to be:
  * Complete: Test things that are likely to be flawed and a few general cases.
  * Concise: Developing and running tests shouldn't take prohibitive time.

Do these tests appear "complete and concise"?

## Finishing the code

If your code didn't pass all tests update it until it does. (These test don't have anything that should be considered a flaw)

# Arrays as return values: `filledArray()`

> **If working with a partner change who is at the keyboard**

Arrays can also be returned from methods. Review the code for `filledArray()` in  `Methods.java`.  As before, pay attention to the JavaDoc comment, return type, parameter types, and name.  Do they all seem to be reasonable choices?

## Finishing the Code

Complete the code for `filledArray()`.

## Testing

Open `FilledArrayTests.java` and review the test cases.  Notice that the `testSizeZero()` case uses `assertTrue` to check a logical condition rather than `assertEquals`, which was used by previous examples.

Notice that `testSizeFive` does two separate tests. **It has an flaw in the first thing it's testing.**  Run the tests and notice the error message printed when it fails. Click on the test case and it will take you to the line of code where the failure was noticed. Update the test code (in `testSizeFive`) to remove the error. Don't remove the line of code. Just update it so it's checking for the proper value. Also notice that the second part of the method uses a loop to check several items.  

## Finishing the Code

If your code didn't pass all tests update it until it does.

# Methods from scratch & re-using methods: `arrayMean()` 

> **If working with a partner change who is at the keyboard**

Return to `Methods.java` and search for `arrayMean`.  You should find the `TODO` comment.  Create a method named `arrayMean` in place of the comment. It should:

* Be declared as `public static`.  Don't forget to include them before the return type.
* Have an appropriate return type (Hint: Consider example problems, like the mean of {2,1} or {1,2,3,1})
* Have appropriate parameter name(s) and type(s).
* Return the mean (arithmetic average) of a set of integers.
  
**Hint this method can be done with just a single line of code in the body.  Leverage your prior work on the studio!**

## JavaDoc-style comment

After writing the code for the method create the JavaDoc style comment before it.  Type `/**` above the method and hit return.  It will automatically create a JavaDoc style comment block.  Fill it in using the same style as used in the rest of the examples.

## Testing

Open `ArrayMeanTests.java`.  The  test cases are all commented out with `//` style comments. You can remove the comments all at once by highlighting all the lines of code that start with `//` and hitting `Control-/` (on a PC) or `Command-/` on a Mac.  If you see red underlines your method may not be using the name or parameters that were expected.  Review the structure of the test case and update your method to match.

Run the tests.  If your code didn't pass all tests update it until it does.

Notice that these tests don't perform a test with an empty array. Take a few minutes to consider why such a test may not be appropriate here. Discuss with a TA/instructor.

# `void` methods: `bullsEye()`

> **If working with a partner change who is at the keyboard**

Imaging you plan to create a simple computer game that allows players to throw fruit at [bull's eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullseye_(target)).  As the game progresses you'll need to draw bull's eyes at different locations on the screen and of varying sizes.  That is, you will want to repeatedly draw bull's eyes, but the specific details of how they are drawn will vary in predictable (computable) ways.  This is a perfect place to use a method.  The method will allow someone to draw a bull's eye and customize the two details that will need customized: the location and size of the bull's eye.

## Finishing the Code

Review the partial code for `bullsEye()` in  `Methods.java`.  Pay attention to the JavaDoc comment, return type, parameter types, and name.  Do they all seem to be reasonable choices?  **Notice that the return type is `void`.  This method is used to bundle together common work, but it doesn't create a new piece of information like a mathematical function. The special word `void` is used to indicate that it doesn't return anything.**  The `println()` method you've been using all semester is an example of another `void` method.  `println` has a side effect of placing text in the console window, but it doesn't "return" a result.

Complete the code for `bullsEye()`.

## Testing
 
Open `BullsEyeTests.java` and review the test cases.  In this case we need to confirm that drawings are correct.  The test cases are used to make a repeatable way of doing tests to ensure consistently, but they will require human intervention to confirm if the test was passed or not. (There are ways to truly automate tests like this, but it's beyond the scope of this class)

Run the tests.  If your code didn't pass all tests update it until it does.

# Generate JavaDoc pages

> **If working with a partner change who is at the keyboard**

JavaDoc style comments are used to easily create documentation that goes along with code. If done correctly, the documentation will allow other people to use code without having to read through all the tedious details or having to guess about its behavior.  Create JavaDoc pages for your work by selecting `Generate JavaDoc...` from the `Tools` menu in IntelliJ.  You may have to indicate where the docs should be place in the `Output directory:` field.  Click on the folder icon (of `Output Directory:`) and create a new folder to put the documentation in (maybe named `docs`). The hit `OK`.  It should generate files in the newly created directory and will even show you them as web pages in your browser. (If your browser doesn't open to them, use your computer's file explorer/finder to look at the folder and open `index.html`). If you click on the `Methods` tab of this page you should see how the JavaDoc was taken from the file and turned into a webpage.  In particular look at the documentation that was created for your `arrayMean()` method.

# End of Studio Review

Major highlights from this studio:

* Methods are a technique used to combine common work into small, stand alone "sub programs".
  * This can be used to avoid copying/pasting code.  Just bundle it into a method and "call it" when it needs to be used.
  * It's also used to break complex tasks into smaller, easier to read/write parts.
* Methods may have parameters (variables) that can be used to communicate information to the method.
  * Parameters allow the behavior of a method to be customized as needed.  For example, to specify the points to use when computing distances or the location and size to draw a bull's eye.
  * Parameters have a type.  
    * Complex things like arrays can be used as parameters.
    * If there is more than one parameter, they are in a distinct order (and order matters).
* Methods can "return" information, which is usually used in an assignment statement, like `double dist = distanceBetween(0,0, 15,8.4)`.
  * The returned "thing" can be a complex thing, like an array that contains several values.
* Methods don't have to return information.  They can just be used to bundle together work with a sensible name (like `bullsEye(0.5, 0.25, .1)`).
* Testing can help ensure that methods work in the expected way.  Passing tests only indicates the code did what those tests were expecting.  Typically passing tests *is not proof* that code will always work.  None the less, unit testing is a vital part of developing large, complex pieces of software.  We try to verify that the individual parts work as expected and then combine them together.
* Testing often involves running code on a specific test cases and making sure it produces the expected results.
