# Warmup
* First, form a group of two people (or three if absolutely needed). You can access the repository for your group here. One member of your group will create the group then the rest of your group should use the same link to join your group.   <br/><br/>When importing the project be sure to:
  1. Close all projects (in every open IntelliJ window pick `File > Close Project`)
  2. Once you get back to the initial IntelliJ window (small square box):<br/>![IntelliJ Start Window](../../../assignments/IntelliJStartWindow.png){:width="50%"} <br/>select the `Check out from Version Control` option.
  3. Use the repo URL
  4. As you step through the import process **give each window a second to search for the required resources**.
* All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work
* Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
* Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard. There are four parts of this studio (Parts of a Recursive Method, Iteration vs. Recursion, Recursion with a Helper Method, and Divide and Conquer), so in a group of 4 one student would be in charge of the keyboard for each part.


# Overview

In this studio you will explore recursion in various forms:

* Parts of a recursive method
* Recursion as it compares to iteration
* Recursion that utilizes a helper method
* Recursion that is used to divide and conquer

You will also spend time analyzing recursive methods and identifying:

* The base case
* The recursive substructure

> **Important!** Today you must rotate who is doing the typing as you move from one method to the next.  Every person in your group must have a chance to be the <I>lead</I> person at the keyboard for at least one method described below.
>
> All group members are encouraged to help the lead person at the keyboard.

In preparation for the exercises open the following files, found in the **studio6** source folder of your repository:

* `Methods` is a file in which you will type the methods described below.
* There are several separate files that will be used to test each method using the JUnit library: `GeometricSumTests.java`, `GreatestCommonDivisorTests.java`, `ReverseTests.java`, and `TriangleTests.java`.

# Parts of a Recursive Method

Recall from the prep work that all recursive methods have two main features: a base case and a recursive call. But how do we determine what those pieces should be for a given problem?

Let's examine the case of a geometric sum. A geometric sum can be computed as follows:

<img src="../../../studios/geo.svg">

Now say that we wish to compute the geometric sum for the first N terms, where 1/2 is the 1st term, 1/4 is the 2nd term, etc. Take a moment to reformulate the equation in terms of N (you'll probably want to get out some paper and a pencil for this).

Within this formulation of a geometric sum is a recursive structure and a base case. Consider the following questions:

* If I am computing the first N geometric terms, when should I stop? There are two possible values that make sense here but since we are trying to determine the base case, we would prefer to use the more stable of the two values. Which value is that?

* What is the recursive substructure here? In order to answer this question we need to find a way to define the problem <u>in terms of itself</u>. In other words, can I define geometricSum(N) that includes another call to geometricSum()? The recursive call to geometricSum() here must be chosen carefully...we must use a value other than N. In fact we will likely want to choose a value <u>based on the current value of N</u>, modifying N in such a way that it moves closer to the base case.

After thinking about these questions, see if you can code up a recursive method called `geometricSum` that takes in a value for `N` and returns the geometric sum for the first `N` terms. Test your work using the `GeometricSumTests.java` file.

Be prepared to discuss the base case and recursive substructure with the instructor or TA when demoing this studio.

# Recursion vs. Iteration

Recursion and iteration (loops) share some similarities. In fact, it is often the case that a solution that uses iteration can be rewritten using recursion. For this part, you are tasked with writing a method that computes the greatest common divisor in two different ways: iteratively and recursively.

The greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest integer that evenly divides both integers. So, for example the greatest common divisor of 27 and 36 is 9. The greatest common divisor of 48 and 14 is 2.

The computation of greatest common divisor can take many forms, but one of the most common ways that is it computed is by applying the following rule:

The greatest common divisor of two numbers, `p` and `q` is equal to `p` if `p % q` is equal to zero. Otherwise it is equal to the greatest common divisor of `q` and `p % q`.

Using the above definition, your task is now to construct two methods to compute the greatest common divisor: gcdIterative should use iteration (loops), while gcdRecursive should use recursion. Once you have finished these two implementations, check your work using the supplied `GreatestCommonDivisorTests.java` file.

Take a look at your two implementations: do you see similarities between them? Can you match up pieces from the iterative and recursive solutions to see how they are essentially computing the result in the same way just with a different structure?

Walk through the recursive execution of gcdRecursive(48, 14). How many recursive calls does it take to get to the answer? Use the debugger to work through this particular problem and verify your answer and be prepared to discuss this when you demo the studio.

# Recursion with a Helper Method

In the previous section we saw how recursion and iteration share some similarities. An important similarity is that recursive methods will repeat, just like iterations through a loop. This repitition is useful but like iteration, there may be things that we don't want to repeat. With iteration we would put this non-repetitive code outside of the loop, but where can it go with recursion?

The solution to this problem is to use something called a helper method. The idea here is that instead of putting all of our repetitive and non-repetitive code into one method, we can move the recursive part of our method to a helper method. This keeps the recursive, repetitive part of our code in the helper method and the non-repetitive, non-recursive part of our code in a separate method. This separate method will typically be the method that is called first and after performing any tasks that it needs to perform it will call the recursive helper method.

Another nice advantage of this approach is that because the helper method is a "bonus" method, we can construct this method however we want. We might decide that this method should have some additional input parameters to make the recursive work a bit easier to manage.

Your next task is to develop a recursive solution to reversing the contents of an array. You should create a method reverse(int[] array) that will return the reversed version of the input. In order to do this you will likely need a helper method. Your helper method will need additional parameters to assist with the recursion (hint: how can we keep track of where we are currently at in the array?). The non-helper method can then simply call the helper method and return the result. The non-helper method can also handle special cases (what if the length of the array is zero or one?) that don't require any repetition to handle. Note that for this problem you are not allowed to use loops and you should not need to create any arrays.

Once you have your method written, use the `ReverseTests.java` file to check your work.

# Divide and Conquer

![Sierpinski Triangle](../../../assignments/triangle.png)

The image above is an example of Sierpinski's Triangle, a very famous recursive problem. This particular problem is a great example of a concept called divide and conquer. Under divide and conquer, multiple recursive calls are used to split the problem into smaller pieces (dividing). Each piece is then solved (or conquered) independently of the other pieces.

Sierpinski's Triangle has a natural point of division: each triangle (including the largest triangle) can be split into three smaller triangles. Each of these three smaller triangles can then be split into three smaller triangles, etc. until you have reached the desired depth.

Your task is now to implement Sierpinski's triangle. The method itself should be responsible for drawing one (and only one!) triangle at a time. The recursive substructure is defined in the above paragraph - keep in mind that your method will probably have <u>three recursive calls</u> one for each sub-triangle. Think about what information you need to keep track of for each of the triangles. For the base case, keep track of how many levels deep you are and stop the recursion at the level of your choosing. You will likely need a helper function that tracks the boundaries of the triangle that is currently being worked on.

For additional fun, incorporate different colors for each sub-triangle!

Once you have completed your implementation, use the provided `TriangleTests.java` to check your work.

# Submitting your work

To submit your work contact the instructor or a TA. They will walk you through the submission process. For each problem you should be prepared to discuss:

* What is the base case?
* What is/are the recursive step(s)?

If a problem asked you to sketch something out on paper, be prepared to show your work during the demo.
