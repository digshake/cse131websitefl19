Studio 7 Secret Design Changes<br>For TA eyes only (shhhhh)
</CENTER></H2>
<html>
<p>
<B>Do not leave this piece of paper where the students can see it. Keep
it to yourself and use it to generate an 11th hour change to the design.</b>
<p>
Pick one of the objects below that the group has implemented,
and ask them to make one or more of the changes indicated for that object type.
<DL>
 <DT> <KBD>Rectangle</KBD>
 <DD> 
 <UL>
  <LI> A rectangle can return the rotate-90 of itself, which is a new
     rectangle whose width and length are the length and with of this
     rectangle.
  <LI> A rectangle has an (x,y) location for its upper-left-hand corner.
   It can tell whether another point (a,b) is inside the rectangle or not.
  <LI> (continuation of the above)  A rectangle can tell whether it
     intersects another rectangle. <BLOCKQUOTE>There is a trick that makes this
     easy if they have done the above change already.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 </UL>
 <DT> <KBD>Die</KBD>
 <DD> A die can be fair or loaded.  When fair, it picks numbers randomly
      and fairly for the result of a throw.  When loaded, it picks side
      1 50% of the time, and then picks uniformly the rest of the time
      between its other sides.  The state of the die (fair or loaded)
      can be changed after the die has been constructed, and it is possible
      to ask the die about its fair or loaded state.
<p>
<DT> <KBD>Fraction</KBD>
<DD> 
A fraction can tell whether it is smaller than, equal to, or greater than
another fraction.
<p>
 <DT> <KBD>Complex</KBD>
 <DD>
A complex number can return its Euclidean distance from 0+0<i>i</i>.
<p>
<DT><KBD>HockeyPlayer</KBD>
<DD>
Sometimes a player gets injured, and hopefully
sometime later, that player returns to being able to play.  It should
be possible to determine if a player is currently injured or not, and
doesn't seem like player should be able to record goals and
assists while injured.
<p>
<DT> <KBD>UnivCourse</KBD>
<DD> 
A Room object must be designed.  A Room has a certain capacity for
seating students.  It should be possible to determine whether a
given course can fit in a given room (which object should have
this method?  Room?  UnivCourse?)
