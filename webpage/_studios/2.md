# Warmup

* First, form a group. You can access the repository for your group <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/J6cYsawt" target="_blank">here</a>. One member of your group will create the group then the rest of your group should use the same link to join your group.
* All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work.
* Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
* Throughout the studio you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard.

# Problem 1: Gambler\'s Ruin

## Background
In this assignment you will simulate the Gambler\'s Ruin problem. The problem is as follows: 
* you're a gambler given some initial amount of money (a start amount) that you'll have everytime you to a casino, and 
* each time you play, you either win or lose $1 based on your "win probability" (the likelihood of wining). 
* You have some goal in mind, that once reached, you stop gambling (leave the casino), 
* Or if you lose all of your money, you also stop gambling. 

You'd like to identify the probability that you'll lose all of your money.  There are two ways to do this: 
* By simulating the many gambling sessions and using the results to estimate the probabilty of "ruin"
* By using a mathematical formula that computes the "expected" answer.  This is the value you should find if you ran your simulation an infinite number of times.

In this assignment you'll do both (and compare the simulated value to the expected one)

## Procedure

1. With your repository open, create a new class in the <KBD>studio2</KBD> package.
	* Right click Right-click on the package name in which you want to define the new class. In this case, use `studio2`.
	* Click `New...`
	* Choose `Java Class`
	* Pick the name `Ruin` for this class. Java style dictates that its classes should begin with a capital letter!
	
2. Have your program accept the following inputs (If you don\'t remember how to do this, look at code from a previous studio or lab):
	
	`startAmount`
	: The amount of money that you start with
	
	`winChance`
	: The probability that you win a gamble
	
	`winAmount`
	: If you reach this amount of money, then you won
	
	`totalPlays`
	: The number of times you simulate the problem

4. Simulate the Gambler\'s Ruin **`totalPlays`** times. For each simulation, continue gambling until you 
	either reach your goal or you ruin. For each simulation, print the simulation number, the number of rounds that 
	simulation played for, and whether you won or lost.  (**Get this part working before proceeding:  See the examples values and corresponding sample output below. It should look somewhat like this, but since you're using random values the results may not be identical.**)

3. Next, include calculation of the "expected ruin rate" in your program using the following formula:

	> if (lossChance != winChance)<br>
	> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruin = ((lossChance/winChance)<sup>startAmount</sup> - (lossChance/winChance)<sup>winAmount</sup>) / (1 - (lossChance/winChance)<sup>winAmount</sup>)
	> <br><br>
	> if (lossChance == winChance)<br>
	> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruin = 1 - startAmount / winAmount
4. Finally, print the total number of losses, simulations, your actual ruin rate, and your 
	expected ruin rate.

Given this input:

-------------|--------------:
`startAmount` | 12 |
`winChance`  | 0.25 |
`winAmount` | 15 |
`totalPlays` | 31 |


Your final output should look similar to this:

<pre>
		Simulation 1: 22 rounds  	LOSE
		Simulation 2: 18 rounds  	LOSE
		Simulation 3: 20 rounds  	LOSE

# Problem 2: Computing Pi by throwing darts

Computer scientists often use [simulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation "simulation") as a means of
modeling, understanding, and predicting real-world phenomena.

Your group is auditioning for [survivor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_%28TV_series%29){:target="_blank"}
by proving your group\'s ability to compute [Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi){:target="_blank"} using
only the materials at hand, as follows:

* A unit-square dart board (say, 1 meter by 1 meter).  Unit-square
 dart boards are astoundingly resilient in plane crashes,
 and yours is nicely intact.
* Some darts, suitable for throwing at the dart board.
* A string and a stylus, standard safety-kit issue, suitable for
inscribing a unit circle in your unit-square dartboard.
* A dart-throwing expert.  However, since the plane crash, the
expert is left with the (uncanny) ability to throw darts that always land
somewhere, uniformly and randomly, within the unit-square dart board.

> While the thrower never misses the unit square, the darts land sometimes within the inscribed circle, sometimes not.

1. As a group, develop an approach for computing [Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi){:target="_blank"} based on
the above materials.
2. Implement your approach using iteration. You can start with the following
<a href="../../../studios/Pi.java" target="_blank">Pi.java</a> file that you can paste into a new
Java class in one of your lab projects.
	You will need to simulate a random dart thrower. The function `Math.random()` will help, as it returns a nonnegative
	double less than 1.0.  You may also find the `Math.sqrt()` function to be helpful.
    This may be the first new Class you have developed, but eclipse makes it easy:   
	* Right-click on the package name in which you want to define the new class.  In this case, use `studio2`.
    * Click `New...`
    * Choose `Java Class`
    * Pick the name `Pi` for this class, since the code you will paste is for class `Pi`. **Java style dictates that its classes should begin with a capital letter!**
	* When the editor opens for your new class, copy and paste the code from
    <a href="../../../studios/Pi.java" target="_blank">Pi.java</a> into the class.
3. Investigate and discuss how well your
technique computes [Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi Wiki"){:target="_blank"}.


# Further investigations


If you have time, pick one or both of the following:

1. Investigate the fairness of the [`Math.random()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random(){:target="_blank"} "Math.random() docs") method.
	1. What normative criteria should a random number possess?
	2. How can you measure the fairness of a random number generator?
	3. Implement some tests and discuss your results amongst yourselves and
	other groups.
2. There are other ways of [computing Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi Wiki"){:target="_blank"}.
Try some of these and study their effectiveness in terms of the number of iterations you use.


# Submitting your work:
