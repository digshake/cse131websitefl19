* This will be a TOC
{:toc}

# Warmup
* First, form a group. You can access the repository for your group <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>. One member of your group will create the group then the rest of your group should use the same link to join your group.
* All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work
* Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.
* Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard. Before doing so, **commit your work** to make sure your work is saved

# Overview

In honor of the upcoming [UN Day](http://www.un.org/en/events/unday/){:target="_blank"}, you will select (or design) a flag of your choice and create that flag using the drawing methods available in Sedgewick\'s library.

This studio is not only focused on understanding how to draw things using Sedgewick\'s library (also known as `StdDraw`), but also about what it means to *design at the intersection of human beings and computers*. Design at its core is all about communicating your own intentions in a way that other people can understand. Human-centered design means you're always thinking about the end users of your work. Further, in this case, it is important to think about technical limitations and restraints on what you can easily draw.

# Procedure

## Individual exercise: create your ideal country

Work *individually* on all of the following:

1. Take out paper and a pencil (or something to draw with)
2. Think about a couple words or phrases you would use to describe your ideal country. These should be concepts you would want to communicate using your national flag. A couple questions to ask yourself are:
   * What are the founding principles of your country?
   * What does your country care about?
   * What major exports do you envision for your country?
   * What\'s the landscape of your country?
   * What kind of food does your country eat?
3. Individually, write down these words or phrases on your piece of paper. (You should have no more than three words or phrases)

## Individual exercise: create your country's flag

Continuing to work *individually*. Based on the words and phrases that describe your country, take a few minutes to sketch out your country's flag by yourself. Keep in mind that you are creating something for the world to see. Hopefully, other people feel the same way you do about this flag and would be able to guess what keywords you based it on.

You may want to review the [`StdDraw` API](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html){:target="_blank"} to get a sense of it's capabilities (and limitations).  

Consult with a TA for feedback about drawing your design with `StdDraw`.

## Group exercise: create your group flag

1. Come back together with your studio group. Without telling each other which words and phrases you based your design on, share your flags with the other members in your group. See if you can guess what each flag is supposed to represent.
2. Now, you are going to create your group flag by taking your favorite features of each flag and designing a singular flag to represent the combination of the individual flags. Make sure a component of each flag is captured in the unified flag. Once again, keep in mind that you need to be communicating your own ideas in a way that others can understand.

## Interacting with other groups: Get Feedback!

* A crucial component to the design process is getting feedback from others and incorporating that feedback into your work.
* Find a group next to you, and share your group flag with them. Do not tell them the words or principles you based your flag on and see if they can guess. Take note of what their guesses are! Are their guesses close to what you intended, or are they way off? What does this say about your design and the way you communicate your ideas?
* Take notes of their guesses and feedback!
* Tell the other group what your flag was actually based on, and see if they have any suggestions on how to modify it to make it clearer to others.
* Make sure to give feedback after receiving it!
* Now, go back to your table and try to incorporate their feedback into your design! What do you need to change? Do you need to change a couple small things or the whole layout?
* Don't be afraid to completely redo it. We all make mistakes and part of the design process is realizing our mistakes and not being afraid to do something over! It's all about iteration.


## Draw your flag

Now that you have perfected your flag using the feedback provided, it is time to code it!
* Open the `studio4` package in the `src` folder, and open the `Flag` class.  That class is currently empty except for the `main`.
* Insert code that creates the flag your group created.
  * Some thing to note:
    * Most of the drawing methods use the coordinates for the center of the object and details needed to draw outward from the center, like the radius for circles, or a half-width and  half-height for rectangles. Be aware of this!
    * If you want colors, they are already in the Sedgewick libraries. If you start to type something like: `sedgewick.` then eclipse will fill in possibilities after the . which will include the colors at the top of that list.

* Frame your flag by surrounding it by a black rectangle of substantial thickness, (an unfilled rectangle).
* When done, allow your studio neighbors and TAs to admire your work.

## Compose an anthem for your flag

1. Find the `PlayThatTune` program in the `coursesupport` source folder.
2. Run the program and make sure you can hear some sound when you play a given piece.
   * The music files come from the `music` folder in your project. The program lets you choose any of the files in that directory, or you can navigate elsewhere if you wish.
3. Based on what you see in the `Ascale.txt` file, design a piece that is your own anthem by specifying the pitches and durations.
   * You can do this by modifying an existing file in the music folder (for example, there is already a `National_Anthem.txt` file, so you can just modify that), or you can create a new text file in that same folder and place your composition there.
   * If you are really unclear how to do this, no problem, you can just use one of the existing compositions.
   * Or, you could generate tones and durations randomly. Pick values that seem similar to what you see in the music files.
4. Try `PlayThatTune` and select your composition for playing.
5. Once you like it, copy and paste the appropriate code from `PlayThatTune` into your `Flag` program so the anthem plays after your flag and text are drawn.
   * The code you want is everything inside the `main` method; get help if necessary.
   * When you run your code, you will have to select the anthem by hand.
	* If you want the file to open without the user having to choose it, then replace the line:
	~~~
  	ArgsProcessor.useStdInput("music");
	~~~
	with
	~~~
	System.setIn(new FileInputStream("music/National_Anthem.txt"));
	~~~
6. See if you can figure out how to get your anthem to play repeatedly.  This may not seem easy, but it builds on what you know about arrays and iteration.

The [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface){:target="_blank"} for [StdDraw](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html){:target="_blank"} will be very useful as you work on your flag.

> **Warning** The book is missing some of the functionality that is in

> draws a filled rectangle, and that can be useful for drawing a flag.

> See the link above for the full range of possibilities.






## Design your flag

 1. Visit the [Flags of all Countries](http://flagpedia.net/){:target="_blank"} web site, and decide on a flag that your studio group would like to create for this studio.

	> Design (or pick) a flag that has at least 3 shapes on it.  If you need to approximate something by a standard shape, such as a maple leaf by a circle, that\'s fine:  just claim that your flag is somewhat _abstract_.
	>
	> If you want to **design your own flag**, that\'s fine.  Make sure it has at least 3 shapes in it.  Try to come up with a cool name for your flag\'s country.

2. Open the **studio4** package int he **studios** source folder, and open the ``Flag`` class.

	* That class is currently empty except for the ``main``.
	
	* Insert code that creates the flag of your choice.


	> Most of the drawing methods want the *center* of the object to be drawn, along with a radius, or a half-width, or a half-height.   Be aware of this!
	>
	> If you want colors, they are already in the Sedgewick libraries.  If you start to type something like `sedgewick.` then eclipse will fill in possibilities after the `.` which will include the colors at the top of that list.

	* Frame your flag by surrounding it by a black rectangle of substantial thickness, (unfilled).
	
	* When done, allow your studio neighbors and TAs to admire its beauty.

##Display the name of your country

1. In the center of your flag, using a color that allows the text to stand out, write the name of your country on top of your flag.

2. In a (literally) moving display of patriotism, arrange for your program to print the name of your country repeatedly, from the upper-left-hand corner to the lower-right-hand corner.

	> For more drama, pause for a bit between each printing of the country\'s name, to allow for cheering from the crowd. Take a look at the `[show(int t)](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html#show(int)){:target="_blank"}` method to achieve the pause.


## Compose an anthem for your flag

1. Find the `PlayThatTune` program in the `book` source folder, in the `book.ch1` package.

2. Run the program and make sure you can hear some sound when you play a given piece.

	> The music inputs come from the `music` folder in your workspace.  The program lets you choose any of the files in that directory, or you can navigate elsewhere if you wish.

3. Based on what you see in the `Ascale.txt` file, design a piece that is your own anthem by specifying the pitches and durations.

	>You can do this by modifying an existing file in the `music` folder (for example, there is already a `National_Anthem.txt` file, so you can just modify that), or you can create a new text file in that same folder and place your composition there.
	>
	>If you are really unclear how to do this, no problem, you can just use one of the existing compositions.
	>
	>Or, you could generate tones and durations randomly.  Pick values that seem similar to what you see in the music files.

4. Try `PlayThatTune` and select your composition for playing.

5. Once you like it, copy and paste the appropriate code from `PlayThatTune` into your `Flag` program so the anthem plays after your flag and text are drawn.

	> The code you want is everything inside the **main** method;  get help if necessary.
	> When you run your code, you will have to select the anthem by hand.
	> If you want the file to open without the user having to choose it, then replace the line
	>
	> `ArgsProcessor.useStdInput("music");`
	>
	> with
	>
	> `System.setIn(new FileInputStream("music/National_Anthem.txt"));`

	>Eclipse will provide guidance about importing the right classes so this will work.

6. See if you can figure out how to get your anthem to play repeatedly.

    > This may not seem easy, but it builds on what you know about arrays and iteration.
