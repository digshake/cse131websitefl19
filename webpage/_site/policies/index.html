	<p>##Grading Policy</p>

<p>Your course grade in CSE131 will be based on a weighted average of the following components:</p>

<p>###Studio work (7%)
Your work in studio will typically be undertaken in small groups. You are not graded on how far you get, but on how well you explore the issues you are investigating.</p>

<p>###Lab Assignments (40%)
Lab assignments are designed to provide practical experience with central topics of the course. Labs should be completed individually, unless otherwise specified. For each lab assignment, you must demo the completed lab to an instructor or TA to receive credit.</p>

<p>###Extensions(20%)</p>

<p>Extensions are due at three points throughout the semester. You must demo 25 points worth of extensions by each due date. Any extra points that are demoed before a deadline will <em>not</em> count.</p>

<p>###Exams (30%)
There will be one final exam to evaluate your understanding of concepts covered in lecture and in the readings.</p>

<p>###Quizzes (3%)
Quizzes will be given once a week. The quizzes are online and you may use whatever resources you would like to complete them. You will have a week to submit the quiz, and we will provide feedback throughout the week so that you can correct your mistakes and resubmit.</p>

<p>Your course grade will be determined approximately as follows.</p>

      <th>Score Above</th>
      <th>Grade Recieved</th>

<p>Grades will be recorded on Blackboard. Please check there periodically to be sure everything is correct.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about your grade at any time during the course, see the instructor or contact a TA. Please do not direct these kinds of questions to other TAs, unless it is a question about an assignment graded by that particular TA.</p>

<p>##Late Policy</p>

<p>Success in CSE131 depends critically on keeping up with the assignments. At the same time, we don't want you to be stressed out over deadlines. With this in mind, the the following late policy has been established. Please read it carefully so that you understand your options. Exceptions to this policy will be granted only in the case of a documented extended illness, documented family emergency, directly conflicting religious observance, or documented university conflict (such as travel for an athletic event).</p>

<p>Consult the course calendar for quiz dates, exam dates, and lab assignment due dates.</p>

<p>###Quizzes</p>

<p>No make up quizzes are allowed.</p>

<p>###Exams</p>

<p>Exams must be taken on the day they are given. If you anticipate that you must be away from campus on the day of an exam, you should notify the instructor by email at least one week in advance of the date of the exam. Include in your email the reason for the anticipated absence and a list of alternative times when you could take the exam. If you are ill on the date of an exam, you should provide the instructor with documentation of the illness and arrange for a make-up exam date as soon as possible. In any case, you must not discuss the contents of an exam with anyone between the time it is given and the time you take the exam.</p>

<p>###Lab Assignments</p>

<p>Start assignments right away, so you have time to complete them and submit them by the due date. If you wait until the last minute and get stuck, you may have trouble getting help. Also, by finishing labs on time, you will be ready to start each new lab as soon as it is assigned.</p>

<p>The deadline for any assignment may be extended at the discretion of the instructor. The CEC labs may be unavailable for brief periods due to unforeseen circumstances. Such outages are to be expected and will not normally result in an extension.</p>

<p><strong>Two late coupons</strong>: Each student is issued two virtual late coupons for use during this semester. A coupon can be used to extend the time of a lab assignment by exactly <strong>one</strong> week. No penalty will be assessed for the late lab, but the virtual coupon will be consumed. Using a late coupon is the only mechanism for submitting a lab late, and <strong>at most one coupon</strong> can be spent on any lab.</p>

<p><strong>To use a late coupon:</strong> Simply turn in your lab as normal. You do not need to ask for permission, you do not need to notify the TA or the instructor. Late coupons are tracked automatically and we will periodically update how many late coupons you have on Schoology.</p>

<p>###Studios</p>

<p>As stated in the attendance policy, studio sessions are required.</p>

<p>No make up studios are allowed. You are allowed to miss one studio session without affecting your grade.</p>

<p>##Attendance Policy</p>

<p>Attendance in studio is required. If you miss more than one studio session, you will lose 7% of your final grade.</p>

<p>##Collaboration Policy
<strong>Honestly represent your work.</strong> The material you turn in for course credit must be a fair representation of your own work. Copying another's work is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Give help appropriately.</strong> When helping someone, it is important not to simply give them a solution, because then they may not understand it fully and will not be able to solve a similar problem next time. It's always important to take the time to help someone think through the problem and develop the solution. Often, this can be accomplished by asking them a series of leading questions. Remember the old saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Give someone a fish and they'll eat for a day.
Teach someone to fish and they'll eat for a lifetime.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Give credit for help received.</strong> If you receive help from people (besides the TAs and the instructor), you must list their names where appropriate using comments in the material you submit.</p>

<p><strong>Work individually or in groups.</strong> Studio work is collaborative and is always performed in groups of two to four people. Working in groups can be beneficial because you can discuss design options and catch each other's mistakes.</p>

<p>Labs are to be completed individually. You may of course discuss concepts with other students, however we do recommend that if you have specific questions about a lab that you as an instructor or a TA to avoid the appearance of academic dishonesty.</p>

<p>The following situations would be considered violations of the academic dishonesty policy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Showing someone your code or looking at someone else's code. Even if you do not physically posses someone else's code, the act of seeing someone else’s code for a lab assignment (by looking at their computer screen, for example) is against the policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dictating solutions to someone else. Telling someone a solution step by step is the same as giving someone your code, as far as the policy is concerned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finding solutions on the internet. The internet is a valuable resource and we encourage you to use it to learn more about concepts that are presented. It is innappropriate to use the internet to find solutions to problems presented in class, however. If you find yourself looking at something that could be submitted as a solution to a problem presented in class, that is a violation of the academic dishonesty policy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To avoid getting into that situation, you are encouraged to limit your searches to conceptual topics as opposed to concrete problems. For example, a search for "how for loops work" is much more appropriate than "how do I use a for loop to do X".</p>

<p><strong>If in doubt, ask your instructor.</strong> The above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of violations. Be sure to ask in advance if you have any doubts about whether a certain type of collaboration is acceptable. Academic integrity violations carry severe penalties and may result in a failing course grade and/or dismissal from the course or the university.</p>
