<p>A video demonstrating a solution can be found <a href="../../../extensions/lines.mp4">here</a></p>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> source folder, find and open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lines</code> package and the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Lines</code> class contained therein.    The <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> method is provided, and it calls
the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">drawLine</code>,which you must complete.</p>

<p>Do not change the parameters or return type of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">drawLine</code> method!  You are welcome to define
<em>other</em> methods in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Lines</code> class if you wish, but the <code class="highlighter-rouge">drawLine</code> method’s signature (the number and types of its parameters and its return type) must
be preserved as you do your work.</p>

<p>Your task is to devise an algorithm for drawing a line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) using <em>recursion</em>.
It may take you some time to think about how to do that, but once you see the recursive nature of drawing a line,
you will probably need only a few lines of code to accomplish this task.</p>

<p>Please take note of the following guidelines, as you will not receive credit unless your solution follows
the rules of this assignment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The code given to you will perform a test of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">drawLine</code> when you run it as a Java Application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to draw lines interactively using your solution, then run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">InteractiveLines</code> class
  as a Java Application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.line</code> to do any of your work!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only methods you are allowed to use from <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> are <code class="highlighter-rouge">point</code>,
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">setPenRadius</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">setPenColor</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This means you must draw your line one point at a time.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some students approach this problem by computing the slope of the line and
  then incrementally trying to draw pieces of it using recursion. That approach
  comes to grief for vertical lines, which have infinite slope.  There
  is a much easier and satisfying way to solve this problem, but you have
  to think about it.</p>

    <p>Do <strong>not</strong> compute or use the slope of the line in your approach.  We will
  not count the extension if you do that.  Instead, think recursively about
  how a line is constructed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you are done it should look like this:</p>

							<h2 id=2>Extension 6.2: Persian Recursion (10 points)</h2>
							<dl>
  <dt>Authors</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/">Ron K. Cytron</a></p>
  </dd>
  <dd>The idea for this assignment comes from the article “Persian Recursion” by Anne M. Burns that appeared on pages 196-199 of <em>Mathematics Magazine</em>, volume 7, in 1997</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A video demonstrating my solution can be found <a href="../../../extensions/persian.mp4">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That video instructs you how to speed up the drawing substantially.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don't speed things up until you see the rug is drawing properly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> folder open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">recursivepatterns</code> package and
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PersianRug</code> class.
Your task is to complete the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">persianRug</code> so that it draws a rug similar to the
one shown below:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/rug.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">persianRug</code> works on a given square of the rug.   Consider the picture shown below:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/orig.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The square is described by its lower-left corner (in this case, (0,0)), and its size (in this case, 1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each step of the recursion considers the colors of the provided square's sides (in this case, blue), and computes
  a color for the two lines to be drawn inside the square (in this case, red).</p>

    <p>Computing the color of these two lines is what makes the rug look as it does.  More detail is given below
  concerning how to pick a color.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further recursion would act on the sub-squares you see in the above picture.  For example, the upper-left
  subsquare has its lower-left corner at (0, 0.5), has size 0.5, and has colors blue, red, red, blue, starting from
  north and proceeding clockwise.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The parameters for <code class="highlighter-rouge">persianRug</code> are documented in the source code provided to you for this extension.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Colors in this lab are represented as an index into a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Color</code> array called <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette</code>.  This
  array is provided for you in the source code and it is passed into your
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">persianRug</code> method.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indexes into <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette</code> are passed into <code class="highlighter-rouge">persianRug</code> to describe the colors of the
square's bordering edges.  For example, blue is represented by index 0 into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette</code> array,
and cyan appears at index 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Picking a color for the two lines drawn inside a given square is the <em>creative</em> aspect of this
assignment.  The following should be read carefully and understood before you jump into coding.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Although you will eventually pick more diverse colors, we recommend that unti your lab is working,
  you should always use color index 0 for the color of the two drawn lines.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once that is working, you must pick a color that is a function of the square's bordering colors (which
  are conveniently represented as indexes into <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette</code>.   That function must have the following
  properties to perform correctly:</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function must return a value that is an appropriate index into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette</code> array.</p>

    <p>As you know, 0 is the smallest index, and the largest index is <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette.length-1</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function must return the same value for any permutation of a given square's bordering colors.
  For example, if the colors are specified in order red, blue, blue, red, then any square with two blue and two 
  red sides must compute the same color for the two drawn lines.</p>

    <p>Recall that these colors are represented as integers, each being an index into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette</code> array.
  What kinds of functions on integers return the same result no matter the order of those integers?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Different functions will produce different rugs.  The rug below is computed using the same code as the rug shown at the top of this assignment, but the function was tweaked slightly:</p>

    <p><img src="../../../extensions/otherrug.png" alt="" />
  Perhaps you can see that in the above rug, once a square has red on each of its borders, the two drawn lines inside that square are also red.
  That effect just happens to be a property of the function I used to produce
  the above image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rugs contributed Fall 2013:</p>

							<h2 id=3>Extension 6.3: Flower Power (4 points)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A video demonstrating my solution can be found <a href="../../../extensions/flower.mp4">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> folder open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">recursivepatterns</code> package.<br />
The following classes found there, and described in greater detail below, must
be completed for this extension:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">TransparentColor</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Flower</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The ultimate goal is to complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">flower</code> method of the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Flower</code> class so that it draws an image similar to the one
shown below:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/flower.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The colors shown in the above image are somewhat <em>transparent</em>, so that
the color of an ellipse is allowed to bleed through the ellipse above it.</p>

<p>You can proceed by working on either class first.  However, if you postpone
<code class="highlighter-rouge">TransparentColor</code>, you will see solid colors in your flower until
you have completed that class.</p>

<p>##Details</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">TransparentColor</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>As is the case with most color models, Java's 
  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">Color</a> 
  objects
  are allowed to have a degree of transparency.</p>

    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">transparentColor</code> method, as provided to you, ignores the
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> parameter and returns the color provided as input.</p>

    <p>You must change this behavior so that the color returned as the same
  red, green, and blue components as the provided color, but with the
  specified transparency.</p>

    <p>Java makes this easy, because there is a constructor for
  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">Color</a> 
  that does the job.
  This task is given to you primarily to acquaint you with the process of looking
  through JavaDoc documentation to find a class or method you need.</p>

    <p>Follow the instructions provided in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TransparentColor</code> source code.</p>

    <p>Before moving on, test your code by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">TransparentColor</code> as
  a Java Application.  You should see the colors solid at the upper right of
  the drawing window, and blended (more transparent) at the lower left.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">Flower</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Your task here is to complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">flower</code> method, whose parameters
  are described in the JavaDoc for the method.  Some useful guildines follow:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> class offers a <code class="highlighter-rouge">filledEllipse</code> method,
  but you must set the color before calling it.</li>
      <li>
        <p>You should choose a random color for each ellipse you draw, and you are
  provided a <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette</code> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Color</code> objects as input to
  your <code class="highlighter-rouge">flower</code> method.</p>

        <p>If necessary, review the material in the text and slides that discusses how
  to pick a random integer.  You would use that integer to index the
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">palette</code> array.</p>
      </li>
      <li>You must find the substructure in the flower pattern.  To help
  with this, the following
  diagram shows the locations of each ellipse within a given level of recursion:</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="../../../extensions/five-recursive-calls.jpg" alt="" /></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Analyze the above diagrams to infer the area taken up by each sub-ellipse
  that you must draw.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remember that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> coordinate system has (0,0) at the 
  lower-left, and (1,1) at the upper right.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remember that <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> shapes take a center as their primary
  coordinate, and use half-widths and half-lengths for dimensions.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>As usual, ask for help as needed.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>You have written the recursive function for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci Sequence</a> in studio.  In this extension, you will
compare the running time of that recursive formulation with an
iterative formulation of the same function.</p>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fibonacci</code> package in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code>
 source folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">recursive</code> method so that it returns the
  <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> fibonacci number using the recursive proram
  from <a href="studio.html">studio</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">iterative</code> method so that it computes the
  same function, but iteratively.</p>

    <p>As a hint, you will need two variables that represent the 
  <em>(n-1)</em><sup>th</sup> and
  <em>(n-2)</em><sup>th</sup> values of the sequence.  Adding those together
  produces the
  <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> term.  The variables' values are then shifted prior
  to the next iteration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">CorrectnessTest</code> to make sure your functions are
  computing the correct values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will now compare the timing of the two methods.
  First run <code class="highlighter-rouge">TimedTest</code>, and give it a little time to finish. Right click the <code class="highlighter-rouge">outputs</code> folder and click refresh. You should now see two excel file outputs in the folder. Open them up and plot the points, observing the difference in time between the iterative and recursive methods.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
