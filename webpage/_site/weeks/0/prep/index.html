<p>#Review Course Policies</p>

<p>We meet twice a week. <strong>Tuesdays</strong> will be the due dates for homework assignments. You will need to come to your assigned lab section to demo your assignment to the instructor or a TA to recieve credit. Tuesdays will also be the days that quizzes are assigned. Quizzes are taken online, and you have up to a week to complete them.</p>

<p><strong>Thursdays</strong> are for completing that week's <strong>studio</strong>. A studio is a short problem set that we expect you to complete in class. We do not "grade" them per se, you simply have to show up and try your best. Even if you do not complete a studio before the end of class, you will still get credit for it.</p>

<p>You will be expected to keep up with the prep work for each module. You should do the prep work before showing up to class on Thursdays, so that you are ready to participate in the studio.</p>

<p>You are also required to complete 100 points of <strong>extensions</strong> over the course of the semester. There are extensions presented for each module that relate to the topic presented in that module.</p>

<p>When you have completed a studio or an assignment, you must <strong>demo</strong> it to a TA or the instructor to recieve credit. The person who you demo your work to will ask you questions about your work, so be prepared!</p>

<p>We are using <a href="https://www.schoology.com/">Schoology</a> to track grades. Once your labs, studios, and quizzes have been graded, you will be able to find your grades on Schoology.</p>

<p>If you get stuck in class, be sure to ask a TA or the instructor. If you get stuck on something outside of class, we have set up a message board on <a href="https://www.piazza.com">Piazza</a> that you can use to ask questions.</p>

<p>#Install the required programs</p>

<p>##Install Java</p>

<p>You will first want to make sure to install the most recent version of Java. To do this, go <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Here and choose the appropriate version of Java for either Mac or Windows as shown in the picture below: <br /><br /></a></p>

<p><img src="../../../preps/19.png" /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Once you have downloaded Java, you should run the installer and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>##Installing Eclipse</p>

<p>To install Eclipse, first go <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/">here</a> and download it.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Once you have downloaded Eclipse, you should run the installer. Be sure to select "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" during the installation:<br /><br /></p>

<p><img src="../../../preps/20.png" /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Once Eclipse is installed, go ahead and start it. You should first see a screen asking you to select a workspace that looks similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="../../../preps/21.png" /><br /><br /></p>

<p>If you are using your own computer, you can select the default workspace location by clicking OK. If you are on a lab computer, you should select the <strong>H:</strong> drive.</p>

<p>##Access your repository</p>

<p>The first thing you will need to do is set up a <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a> account. You should have received an email about this. If you have not, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.<br /><br /></p>

<p>This video will walk you through the steps of getting your repository set up in Eclipse. If you’d prefer to read written instructions you can find them below the video.</p>

<iframe src="https://app.box.com/embed/preview/2duvhinq3nyi0n4qftd23em52h3femjv?theme=dark" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Once you have finished setting up your account on BitBucket, you need to create a clone of your repository on your local machine. First, go to the BitBucket page for your repository (your repository should contain "CSE131" and your WUSTL key in the name) and copy the link:<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/15.png" /><br /><br />
Next, open Eclipse and go into your workspace:<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/8.png" /><br /><br />
Go to File -&gt; Import. Then select Git project from the list:<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/9.png" /><br /><br />
Next, select “Clone URI”:<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/10.png" /><br /><br />
Paste the link that you copied from BitBucket into the box at the top. Fill in your BitBucket login (not your WUSTL key!) at the bottom:<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/11.png" /><br /><br />
On this screen, click next:<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/18.png" /><br /><br />
Eventually you will see the following screen. If you are on your laptop, then you do not need to do anything on this screen. <strong>If you are on a lab computer, make sure to choose a location that is on the H:\ drive.</strong> You can do this by typing in a location, or by clicking the "Browse" button and selecting the H:\ drive.<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/17.png" /><br /><br />
Keep clicking next until you see the following screen. Make sure the box next to the CSE131 project is checked:<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/12.png" /><br /><br />
Once you click "Finish", you should see the CSE131 project in your workspace. It should contain all of the materials for labs, studios, and extensions.<br /><br /></p>

<p>#Committing your work</p>

<p>Committing your work is equivalent to turning something in. When you are ready to submit your work, right click the project and select Team-&gt; Commit:<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/13.png" /><br /><br />
Type in a descriptive commit message then push the "Commit and Push" button at the bottom. Make sure to push! If you only commit (without the push) we will not be able to grade your work.<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/14.png" /><br /><br />
You may commit/push as many times as you want. You should commit often! Think of it as saving your work.<br /><br /></p>

<p>#Updating your repository</p>

<p>From time to time we will add files to your repository (such as grades). To do this, you need to update your repository. This can be accomplished by right clicking the CSE131 project and selecting "Pull":<br /><br />
<img src="../../../preps/16.png" /><br /><br />
This will get any changes that have been made to your repository. It is a good habit to run a synchronize before you make any changes to your repository, especially if you are working with a partner.</p>
