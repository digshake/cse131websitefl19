<p>##Overview</p>

<p>In weight training, the volume of work completed in
one exercise (often called a <em>set</em>) is typically specified as a given weight that
is moved a specified number of times.  These are respectively
called the <em>weight</em> and <em>reps</em> (abbreviates repetitions)
of that set.</p>

<p>In this extension, you will create a one-rep max calculator. 
This calculator hypothetically calculates a weight that a subject
could move for one repetition, given that the same subject can successfully
complete <em>r</em> reps (in the range of
2 -&gt; 12) at a lighter weight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Beyond 12 reps,
the formula we use is not considered  accurate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The stated value for <em>r</em> is generally considered to be 
the number of times the weight
can be moved before <em>failure</em>:  the subject can complete <em>r</em> reps
at the stated weight, but no more.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While a person may never attempt that one-rep max movement, the one-rep 
max weight is canonical, in that it can then be used to compute
lighter weights that should be feasible for the subject at a desired number
of reps.</p>

<p>Your solution will compute and print:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The one-rep max weight based on a formula described below.</li>
  <li>The weight that should be feasible for a stated number of reps.</li>
  <li>Percentages of the one-rep max weight from 95% to 50% in decrements of 5%.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Example</p>

<p>Consider a subject who can successfully
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_press">bench</a>
225 pounds 10 times before failure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is this subjects current one-rep max bench weight?</li>
  <li>How much weight should that subject be able to bench to get 5 reps before failure?</li>
  <li>What percentage of this subject's max bench is the weight that can
be benched 5 times?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Input</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Successful weight:  225 pounds</li>
  <li>Successful reps: 10</li>
  <li>Desired reps:  5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<p>##Procedure</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First take a look at 
<a href="http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax.html">this one-rep max</a>
caculator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you try it for some sample values, you will see that it
produces results that may not work in an actual gym, because the smallest plate
one can find in most gyms is 2.5 pounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our calculator takes in a third input, which is how many reps the person 
wants to perform, 
and calculates a weight to be performed at that number of reps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">one-rep max</a>
calculations will be based on the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum#Epley_Formula">Epley Formula</a>,
so study that material sufficiently well to complete this extension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a <strong>OneRepMax</strong> class in the <strong>onerepmax</strong> package
of the <strong>extensions</strong> folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arrange for that program to prompt the user for the inputs needed for
this computation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute and print the results as shown in the sample ouptut above for
the inputs provided in the run of your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Check that the inputs provided are reasonable. Print a suitable message and
  exit if any inputs are unreasonable.</li>
      <li>Use iteration to produce the table of percentages of the one-rep max
  weight.</li>
      <li>Produce weight values that are rounded to the nearest <strong>5 pounds</strong>,
  so that the least weight needed on a bar is 2.5 pounds on each side.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>##Background</p>

<p>In this assignment, you have a balance in your bank account and you randomly either deposit or withdraw money from 
your account every day for one month (30 days). At the end of the month, you receive interest on your balance.</p>

<p>##Procedure</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You start with $4000 in your bank account and earn 2% interest at the end of the month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each day, you always withdraw or deposit money. Half of the time you <strong>withdraw $100.00</strong> and the other 
half of the time you <strong>deposit $200.50</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>How would you use random numbers to determine whether you withdraw or deposit money?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After withdrawing or depositing money, calculate your new balance. Then print the following: 
<strong>Day</strong>, <strong>Type</strong>, <strong>Amount</strong>, <strong>Balance</strong> in a cleanly formatted table.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Since the cent is the lowest denomination in U.S. currency, round your withdrawals, deposits, and balance 
to the nearest cent.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, after the 30th day, calculate and print the amount of interest you earned and your final balance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Your final output should look similar to this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Day	Type		Amount		Balance
1	Deposit 	$200.50		$4200.50
