					<h1 id="exercise-making-change">Exercise: Making Change</h1>

<p>In the repository you are using for this course, look inside the
<strong>exercises</strong> source folder, and you will see assignments organized
by name.  Before continuing on to the next portion of the prep material,
spend some time on the exercise.</p>

<p>It is not so important that you get the exercise exactly right.  It is
important to work through it as best you can before you look at the
solution or continue with other work in this module.</p>

<p>You have some number of pennies, and you would like to determine how to
make change for those pennies to obtain the proper number of each
of the following currencies:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>currency</th>
      <th>pennies</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>dollars</td>
      <td>100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>quarters</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dimes</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>nickels</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In making change, we seek the maximum number of each denomination in 
decreasing order.  For example, given <strong>798</strong> pennies, your program
should print the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>For 798 pennies:
7 dollars
3 quarters
2 dimes
0 nickels
3 pennies
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Find and open the <strong>Change</strong> Java program in the <strong>exercises1</strong> package
of the <strong>exercises</strong> source folder.</li>
  <li>Add code as directed there to prompt the user to supply the number of
pennies.</li>
  <li>Compute and print the output as suggested above.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Hints:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to use integer division and remainder (<strong>%</strong>)
to complete this exercise.</li>
  <li>Review the video materials as necessary for this module.</li>
