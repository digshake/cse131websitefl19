					<p>Read this before starting:</p>

<h1 id="studio-sessions-overview">Studio Sessions Overview:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>We gather as a community in studio session to learn from each other.
Our community includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Instructor</li>
      <li>TAs</li>
      <li>Students</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Our community is egalitarian in terms of learning:
all of us will have questions and all of us should try to provide answers.</li>
  <li>The idea is to challenge each other and to share what we discover.</li>
  <li>You are free (downright encouraged) to collaborate in this session:
    <ul>
      <li>Primarily within your small group of 2-4 people</li>
      <li>Secondarily with any group in the class</li>
      <li>As much as you like with the instructor and TAs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In studio, the instructor's mission is to observe, interact, and work with groups.
    <ul>
      <li>How you think, work, and arrive at a solution is more important than getting the right answer.
Thus, the instructor and TAs will observe you throughout the exercise and offer constructive feedback.</li>
      <li>The help you receive may be incomplete at any given time,
so that you can work through more of the solution on your own.
Do not hesitate to ask for more help.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In studio, the student's mission is to acquire new knowledge and skills by
the collaborative solving of problems.
    <ul>
      <li>You are <strong>not</strong> graded on whether you get wrong or right answers on this exercise.</li>
      <li>You are graded on your level of participation in studio.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Participation is defined as:
    <ul>
      <li>Asking questions, at any level, of any person in the studio</li>
      <li>Discussing possible solutions with people in the studio</li>
      <li>Helping somebody in the studio solve a problem</li>
      <li>Presenting or demonstrating your solution to people in the studio</li>
      <li>Documenting your group's experiences in studio</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please eliminate external stimuli (cell phones, IM, Facebook) during studio.
Please devote yourself to learning, mastering, and extending the material for the session.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In your groups, take turns staffing the keyboard.</p>

      <p>It is unacceptable to copy anything without understanding it.
At any point, the TA or instructor can point to something you've done and ask you why it works,
or change it and ask what would happen with the modification.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>To receive credit for a studio, your team must
cleared by a TA or the instructor.</li>
        <li>Be careful how you use the web.  You are required to develop solutions
as a group by thinking not by finding solutions that have been thought
out by others.  You must be able to explain anything that you have done.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="warmup">Warmup</h1>

<ul>
  <li>First, form a group:</li>
  <li>All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work.</li>
  <li>Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.</li>
  <li>Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="studio-setup-procedure">Studio Setup Procedure</h1>

<p><strong>READ THE FOLLOWING FULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Have <em>one person</em> in your group create a new team by clicking <a href="https://classroom.github.com/g/FJC5749Y">here</a>.
    <ol>
      <li>The team name should include the last name of all your group members.  For example, if Xia and Smith are working together, the team name should be something like “XiaSmith”.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>After the team is created, all other members of your team should click on the same link and follow the instructions to join the team.
    <ol>
      <li><em>Be careful to join the right team!</em>  You won’t be able to change teams yourself and will have to contact instructors if there’s a problem.</li>
      <li><em>Be sure everyone else joins the team!</em>  If grades don’t get entered correctly we will use the team to help verify credit for a particular studio.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="studio-1-activity">Studio 1: Activity</h1>

<ul>
  <li>You will complete a series of simple Java programs, and run each program
to ensure it performs its task correctly.</li>
  <li>The files for this program are in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">studio1</code> package of the repository you loaded.</li>
  <li>
    <p>To run a program, right- (control-)
click on the file's name, choose <code class="highlighter-rouge">Run ...main()</code>.  The program will then
launch and prompt you for the inputs it needs. Try this now on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hello</code> class.  When it asks you how you are feeling, enter whatever comes to mind.</p>

    <p>Once you have run a program, you can run that same program again by clicking the green arrow at the top of the IntelliJ window.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Some of the following exercises are adapted from Princeton University's</strong>
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring12/cos126/precepts.php">COS126 course</a>, based on our text by Sedgewick and Wayne.</p>

<p>For each of the following exercises, find the file in your studio repository
and complete it to do the assigned task.</p>

<h2 id="hione"><code class="highlighter-rouge">HiOne</code></h2>

<p>Say hello to the name supplied as input to this program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sample output: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hi Doug.  How are you?</code> (assuming <code class="highlighter-rouge">Doug</code> was supplied as input)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Feel free to end the output with punctuation that indicates the level of enthusiasm associated with your greeting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hifour"><code class="highlighter-rouge">HiFour</code></h2>

<p>Expand your hospitality to the <em>four</em> names supplied to this program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sample output: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Greetings Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.</code> <strong>Be sure to put in</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">proper punctuation</a> <strong>to separate the names.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="ordered"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Ordered</code></h2>

<p>Define a <code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean</code> variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">isOrdered</code> whose value is
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> if the three values are either in strictly ascending
  order (<code class="highlighter-rouge">x &lt; y &lt; z</code>) or in strictly descending order
  (<code class="highlighter-rouge">x &gt; y &gt; z</code>), and <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> otherwise. Print out the variable
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">isOrdered</code> using <code class="highlighter-rouge">System.out.println(isOrdered)</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of you may already know some Java.  We have not yet covered the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement.  You must use what has been taught so far (simple
expressions and assignment) to accomplish this task.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="average"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Average</code></h2>

<p>Complete this code so that it prints the average of its two integer inputs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sample output:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Average of 5 and 6 is 5.5</code>.</p>

  <p>Note that the output is specified as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code>,
because the average of two integers is not necessarily an integer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, for this one, you are on your own.  We are not giving you code for this, but will instruct you how to create your own Java file from scratch:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right- (control-) click on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">studio1</code> package, select
<code class="highlighter-rouge">New -&gt; Java Class</code>.</li>
  <li>Type the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">Average</code> and create the class.</li>
  <li>Add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">public static void main(String[] args)</code> method in your Average class. Refer back to some of the other files if you are confused on how to do this.</li>
  <li>
    <p>At the top of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> method, you need to insert the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArgsProcessor</code> code to accept two integers: <code class="highlighter-rouge">n1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">n2</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Refer to other studio code to see how this is done.
It is likely that when you type in the code, IntelliJ will flag your code with an error, because it doesn't know (yet) about <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArgsProcessor</code>.</p>

      <p>You can get IntelliJ to solve its own problem by mousing over the error, and using the first suggestion that pops up, namely to include <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArgsProcessor</code> from
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cse131</code> package.
Sometimes IntelliJ is silly and won't tell you about that fix until
you have saved your file.  So save it.</p>

      <p>Try to use meaningful messages to prompt for values.  The units for the values will be interpreted
as <em>grams</em>.  For example, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> is specified for <code class="highlighter-rouge">carbs</code>,
that means that this run of your program is for food that has 3 grams of carbohydrates.</p>

      <p><strong>A not so nice prompt:</strong></p>

      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int n1 = ap.nextInt("Yo, sup?");</code></p>

      <p><strong>And a nice prompt:</strong></p>

      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int n1 = ap.nextInt("The first of two integers to be averaged?");</code></p>

      <p>Run your program and makes sure it prompts you correctly for its values and ask a TA to check your work at this point.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Finish the class so it prints out the appropriate message.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="creative-exercise">Creative Exercise</h1>

<h2 id="ice-cream">Ice Cream</h2>

<p>As a group, brainstorm the best data type to represent the following
situations:</p>

  <li>The percentage of calories in <a href="http://www.teddrewes.com/sitecontent/dynamiccontent.aspx?pid=76&amp;uid=D18D6B6C-7948-4C04-8F59-12F77F9F3F49">vanilla frozen custard</a> that come from fat</li>
  <li>The probability that you will see a friend at <a href="http://www.teddrewes.com/home/default.aspx">Ted Drewes</a> when you go there</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submitting-your-work">Submitting your work:</h1>

<p>To submit your work, contact the instructor or a TA. They will walk you through the submission process. Be prepared to show them the work that you have done and answer their questions about it!</p>
