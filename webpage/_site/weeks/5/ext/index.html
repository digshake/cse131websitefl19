							<h2 id=2>Extension 5.2: Chase, the Mouse (3 points)</h2>
							<dl>
  <dt>Authors</dt>

  </dd>
</dl>

<p>##A Story</p>

<p>Chase, the Mouse, was standing still on the Standard Draw template one day, thinking about the meaning of 
life. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, a ball began to follow Chase. No matter where Chase went the ball would follow and pester Chase until he moved again. 
You will be writing the code for the ball.</p>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

<p>Create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">FollowTheMouse</code> class in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mousefollower</code> package. You will have to write a few specific methods for this extension. 
You can test those with the JUnit test provided in the package.
Once all of these methods are written, you will put them to use in 
the main method to create a Standard Draw template in which a ball follows your mouse. The methods that you must write are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">double[] getMousePosition()</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This method returns an array of two <code class="highlighter-rouge">doubles</code>, the x and y coordinates of the mouse. You can find the coordinates 
  of the mouse on the standard canvas using <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.mouseX()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.mouseY()</code></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Write that method so that the first <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> in the array that you return is the x coordinate of the mouse, and the second <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> is the y coordinate of the mouse.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Test this method using the JUnit test <code class="highlighter-rouge">GetMousePositionTest</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mousefollower</code> class. When you run this test, a ball will appear on a Standard Draw template. Try to follow the ball with your mouse while the test runs.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">drawBall(double[] position, double radius)</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This Method draws the ball wherever it should be in a specific frame.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>This should take in an array of 2 <code class="highlighter-rouge">doubles</code> that specifies the x and y coordinates of the ball and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> for the radius.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Test this by manually drawing a ball in your main method at a specific x and y coordinate. You can use the following code:</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <pre>
  double[] tester = new double[]{.5, .5};
  drawBall(tester, .2);
  StdDraw.show(2000);
  </pre>

    <p>If this draws a large ball in the middle of your template, then your <code class="highlighter-rouge">drawBall()</code> method works!</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">double[] changePosition(double[] position, double[] mousePosition, double speed)</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This should return an array of 2 <code class="highlighter-rouge">doubles</code> that represents the new position of the ball</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>This method takes in an array of 2 <code class="highlighter-rouge">doubles</code> that specifies the original position of the ball, an array of 2 <code class="highlighter-rouge">doubles</code> that 
 specifies the mouse position, and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> for the speed.</p>

        <p>You are not simply drawing a ball at the position of the mouse. The ball should move at a constant speed towards the mouse at all times.
 This will require some basic geometry. However, you will not need to use any trigonometric functions.</p>

        <p><img src="../../../extensions/SimilairTriangles.png" alt="" /></p>

        <p>dx and dy are the distances from the ball to the mouse. The legs of the green triangle represent the x and y components of the distance the ball moves
 in each frame. The hypotenuse of the green triangle represents the total distance the ball moves in each frame. This is, effectively, the “speed” of the ball,
 distance per frame.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Finally, make sure to implement all of these methods in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> method inside of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">while</code> loop, along with the other 
necessary <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> code. It would be helpful to set the initial position of the ball outside of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">while</code> loop, and then alter it inside.</p>

							<h2 id=3>Extension 5.3: Build your own Calculator! (5 points)</h2>
							<dl>
  <dt>Authors</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Arman Guerra</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="a-how-to-guide">A How-To Guide</h2>

<p>In this extension you shall complete the functionality of a calculator. You accomplish this by creating a series of methods that 
use the arithmetic, <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean</code>, and casting operations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In eclipse, open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">calculator</code> package found in
  the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> source folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will find the following Java files:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">Computations</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is where you will be writing your code.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">Calculator</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is what you will run when you are finished writing all of your methods. This class creates a GUI, 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphic User Interface</a>. This is what you see when you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">Calculator</code>, an 
  interface that allows the user to interact with the code. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Calculator</code> will not run until you are finished writing all of your methods, so 
  if you want to check your code, use the unit test provided.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">ComputationsTest</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is the unit test for this extension. Your code must pass this test for you to earn credit. You can check your methods with 
  test as you go. We recommend that you check intermittently to see if you are writing your code correctly, so that if you're making a mistake, you 
  can catch yourself early.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

<p>You will be writing two kinds of methods. The first kind will be the operational methods, which take in two parameters, and return the result of 
some operation. For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// Returns the result of adding d1 and d2.
public static double addDoubles(double d1, double d2) {
	return d1 + d2;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second kind of method will be <em>to</em> methods, which take in some value, and cast it to the necessary type. For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// takes in an int and returns a double
public static double intToDouble(int in) {
	return (double)in;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the input makes no sense, <em>throw</em> an exception. For example, if someone inputs a <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>, converting it to an <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code> would make no sense.</p>

<p>So for the method</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> public static int stringToInt(String in) {
	throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>you would <em>throw</em> an exception that indicates that this operation is unsupported.</p>

<p>When you <em>throw</em> this exception, our code <em>catches</em> the exception, and sends out an error message through the GUI.
You will learn more about this in future classes.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>First you will write:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Double operations, which take in two doubles and output one double:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double addDoubles(double d1, double d2)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double subtractDoubles(double d1, double d2)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double divideDoubles(double d1, double d2)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double multiplyDoubles(double d1, double d2)</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Make sure that the calculator will not crash if a user tells it to divide by zero. If a user tries to divide by zero, return zero.</p>

    <p>At ths point, and at each subsequent point of arrival, run the unit
  test to see if the changes you have made so far pass the test.  At this
  point, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> tests should pass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integer operations, which take in two integers, and output one</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int addInts(int i1, int i2)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int subtractInts(int i1, int i2)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int divideInts(int i1, int i2)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int multiplyInts(int i1, int i2)</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Again, there is a possibility that a user will divide by zero here. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YneYiO1r0Ow"> Do the thing</a> detailed above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A String Operation, which takes in two Strings and concatenates them</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">String concatenate(String s1, String s2)</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boolean operations, which take in two booleans and outputs one</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean andBoolean(boolean b1, boolean b2)</code> which returns the value of the expression <code class="highlighter-rouge">b1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b2</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean orBoolean(boolean b1, boolean b2)</code> which returns the value of the expression <code class="highlighter-rouge">b1 || b2</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Then you will write:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Double <em>to</em> methods, which take in a value and convert it to a double when it makes sense, and throw an error if it doesn't make sense.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double intToDouble(int in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double doubleToDouble(double in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double stringToDouble(String in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double booleanToDouble(boolean in)</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integer <em>to</em> methods, which take in a value and convert it to an integer when it makes sense, and throw an error if it doesn't make sense.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int intToInt(int in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int doubleToInt(double in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int stringToInt(String in))</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int booleanToInt(boolean in)</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>String <em>to</em> methods, which take in a value and convert it to a String when it makes sense, and throw an error if it doesn't make sense.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">String intToString(int in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">String doubleToString(double in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">String stringToString(String in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">String booleanToString(boolean in)</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Boolean <em>to</em> methods, which take in a value and convert it to a boolean when it makes sense, and throw and error if it doesn't make sense.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean intToBoolean(int in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean doubleToBoolean(double in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean stringToBoolean(String in)</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean booleanToBoolean(boolean in)</code></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these methods should be quite short.</p>

							<h2 id=4>Extension 5.4: Watermelon Puzzle (8 points)</h2>
							<dl>
  <dt>Authors</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Arman Guerra</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Adapted from <em>Sit and Solve Brainteasers</em> by Derick Niederman</p>

<h2 id="warm-up">Warm Up</h2>

<p>Five watermelons, each of different weight, have been weighed in <em>pairs</em>
to obtain the following weights:</p>

<p>20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31</p>

<p>One way to solve this would be to figure out a mathematical algorithm for this number of watermelons and work out the weight of each watermelon. 
Another would be to try all of the possible combinations of weights five watermelons until you found one that has this same set of combinations of weights.
Either way you did it, the specific set of watermelons that produces these weights is</p>

<p>[ 9, 11, 13, 14, 17 ]</p>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<p>Since we have computers, and know how to write code, trying all of the possible weights of the five watermelons is now much easier. In this extension, 
you will take in an array of 10 weights, and you will try, iteratively, to come up with the individual weights of the five watermelons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find the code for this extension in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">watermelons</code> package.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create two methods in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Watermelons</code> class. There is one finished method that will help you write the other two 
 methods. The two methods you must create are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">int[] allPairSums(int[] nums)</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This method must be completed first.  Given the input array
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">nums</code>, this method computes the pairwise-sum of each distinct
  pair of index values for that array.  For example, given the
  input <code class="highlighter-rouge">{40, 20, 10, 30}</code>, the method must compute the sums of
  indices 
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">(0,1)</code>,
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">(0,2)</code>,
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">(0,3)</code>,
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">(1,2)</code>,
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">(1,3)</code>,
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">(2,3)</code>, returning the array</p>

        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">{60, 50, 70, 30, 50, 40}</code></p>

        <p>The ordering of the elements in the returned array does not matter.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">int[] getSolution(int[] originalSums)</code></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This method returns a solution to the puzzle for the array of 10 integers that are passed into it. The ordering of elements
  in the array you produce does not matter, as far as the provided unit test is concerned.</p>

        <p>The included method, <code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean sameIntArrays(int[] one, int[] two)</code> 
  will help you with this method. When you pass two integer arrays into <code class="highlighter-rouge">sameIntArrays</code>, it checks whether the two integer arrays contain the same elements.
  The order of the elements in the arrays does not matter.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you pass the provided unit tests.  Once it does, you will
 have a solution to the puzzle.</p>

    <p>For extra fun, go into the code for the Unit test, and inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">int[] genSolution()</code> method, uncomment <code class="highlighter-rouge">List&lt;Integer&gt; ans = genIntsSlow();</code>
 and comment out <code class="highlighter-rouge">List&lt;Integer&gt; ans = genIntsFast();</code>. This will pass larger weights into your <code class="highlighter-rouge">int[] getSolution(int[] originalSums)</code> method, 
 and so the computation will take longer. It could take up to a minute. This is not required, but it is a neat example of a very large computation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The design of software can often be specified using its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>, or Application Programming Interface.  The API specifies the
<em>methods</em> that are offered by the software.  Documentation for those
methods typically includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the <em>signature</em> of each method:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the method's name</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the types of the method's parameters</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the return type (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">void</code>) for the method</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the documentation for the method</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above should be sufficient to use the software, but it can also form
the <em>design</em> document for implementing the software.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For this Tic-Tac-Toe assignment, the API can be found 
  <a href="../../../extensions/TTTDoc/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A video showing how to navigate the documentation can be found
  <a href="../../../extensions/tictactoe.mp4">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This form of documentation is known as
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc">Javadoc</a>.  It can be
  generated automatically from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/**..**/</code> comments that 
  you entered into your work for this module's lab.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find the assignment's code in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tictactoe</code> package of
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watch <a href="../../../extensions/tictactoe.mp4">the documentation video</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement the methods according to the <a href="../../../extensions/TTTDoc/">documentation</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test as you go by running the unit test <code class="highlighter-rouge">TTTTest</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is suggested that you implement the methods in the following order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="../../../extensions/TTTDoc/tictactoe/TicTacToe.html#genBoard--">String[][] genBoard()</a> (actually shown in the video)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="../../../extensions/TTTDoc/tictactoe/TicTacToe.html#verifyValidRow-int-">void verifyValidRow(int))</a></p>

    <p>For this assignment,
 when an improper input is found by methods like this,
 you are required
 to <code class="highlighter-rouge">throw</code> an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html">IllegalArgumentException</a></p>

    <p>An example of that is done for you in <code class="highlighter-rouge">verifyValidPlayer</code>, so take

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

<p>Be creative! Many implementations will satisfy the requirements.</p>

<p>Your slot machine must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A method for drawing the slot machine. Most slot machines have between 3 and 7 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine#Reels" target="new">reels</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A method for randomly picking shapes and their colors and displaying them. It is up to you to decide how many different shapes

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A way to reward multiple win conditions for when all the colors are the same, all the 
  shapes are the same, and both the colors and shapes are the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A way to show the balance that the player has in the machine. Each pull of the lever should cost a certain amount of money (that is

<h1 id="description">Description</h1>

<p>In this extension you complete the second step towards creating slots, the classic casino game. In this game, you pull a lever, and the slots rotate, slow down, and eventually land
on some combination. Based on the combination you have the chance to win a certain amount of money. You will create this machine using 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code>.</p>

<p>##Procedure</p>

<p>This step in your implementation of the slots machine must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can decide: either the slots will slow down and then eventually come to a stop on a random shape, or the user will click, and the shapes will stop.</p>

    <p>Either way, when a slot stops on a shape that shape must appear in the center of the slot, so that the user can tell which shape the slot landed on</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the slots stop, you should print a message telling the user whether or not any points were scored. If the user hit the Jackpot, congratulations are in order. If not, 
inform the user of this with a morose message, such as “you stink” or <a href="https://youtu.be/S3I5XcsReT0?t=10s">this</a>.</p>

    <p>You can write text using <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.text(double xCoord, double yCoord, String string)</code>. If you want to set the font, create a new font and then set that as the font</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  Font f = new Font("Tahoma", Font.PLAIN, 50);
	
  StdDraw.setFont(f);
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Tahoma</code> is the name of the font, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Font.plain</code> is the style, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">50</code> is the size of the font.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should keep the score of the game and display it every time the slots stop. The score should go up every time the user gets 2 or 3 of a kind, and go down otherwise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you display to the user the outcome of the spin, the user should be able to click on the standard draw canvas, and the Jackpot machine should run again.</p>

    <p>If you would like to create a button you can, but it is not required, as long as clicking somehow restarts the animation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of methods that you might add when you modify your Jackpot machine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a <code class="highlighter-rouge">checkStop()</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">slowDown</code> method that stops the slot when the mouse is pressed or slows it down, depending on your implementation</p>

    <p>If you are going to check if the user clicked to stop the slot, check in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">main()</code> method, and pass the coordinates of the mouse (using <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.mouseX()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.mouseY()</code>) into the method that decides which slot will stop, as opposed to finding the coordinates of the mouse in the method that you call. There is a tiny widow of time in which the user could move the mouse out of the way, which could cause you to stop the wrong slot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one or more methods that draw the screen that appears when the slots stop that show the score and write out whether or not the user won anything</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <code class="highlighter-rouge">checkIfFinished()</code> method that returns whether or not all of the slots have stopped moving.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can have more or fewer methods, depending on how you want your implementation to work, but having these will save you a lot of code writing.</p>

<h1 id="description">Description</h1>

<p>Your goal in this extension is to create a memory matching game using <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> and your growing computer 
science knowledge. If you've never played a memory matching game before, you can find a truck themed one 
<a href="http://www.sproutonline.com/games/bill-boards-memory-match" target="new"> here </a>
to get the general idea. Additionally, you can find a video demoing a solution 
<a href="Extensions/memorymatch.mp4" target="new">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this extension, you are going to create a matching game that uses colors rather than images. It should do the following:</p>

<p>##Procedure</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Generate a 4-by-4 grid of clearly distinguishable tiles (you can change your design later to accommodate any even number of tiles if you want, but 4x4 is the base requirement).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The board should be made up of randomly distributed pairs of colored tiles (8 pairs in total); all of these colors are initially hidden. You are welcome to choose the colors yourself, or come up with some way of auto-generating them as long as they are all easily distinguishable from each other. For example, it would not be recommended to use the light gray, gray, and dark gray default <code class="highlighter-rouge">Color</code>s together. Note that the distribution of colored tiles on the board should change from game to game, but the actual colors need not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tiles should start out hidden and should reveal their concealed color when clicked. When a single tile is clicked, it should remain visible until a second is selected. If that second selected tile does not conceal the same color as the first tile then, after a reasonable delay, both tiles should revert to hidden. If the second tile is the same color as the first tile, then both tiles can either remain flipped or simply disappear. The process then repeats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The game must keep track of score. You can do this by either counting the number of clicks it takes before the full board is revealed or timing it. Once the game is over, the score should be displayed on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> canvas somewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the game is over, a single click to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> canvas should start a new game (the player shouldn't need to re-run the program to play again).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Be aware that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">(0,0)</code> coordinate on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> canvas is in the <strong>lower</strong>-left corner while we generally depict the <code class="highlighter-rouge">[0][0]</code> index of a two dimensional array in the <strong>upper</strong>-left, as shown in the drawing below in blue and black respectively. If you store information in arrays, you want to have consistency between the way that information is stored and viewed, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">(0,0)</code> should correspond to the same area as <code class="highlighter-rouge">[0][0]</code>. You can do this however you like, but it's recommended that you change the scale of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> canvas so that its coordinates match those of the array. This can be accomplished with the method, <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.setYscale(double bottomValue, double topValue)</code>.</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/canvasCoords.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Below are the methods you must complete. You are welcome to write additional methods 
to help accomplish this assignment.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Color[][] genBoard()</code></p>

<p>Generates a new board with 8 different color pairs and returns the 4x4 <code class="highlighter-rouge">Color</code> matrix with randomized locations. Must pass the unit test for credit.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">void drawBoard(Color[][] board)</code></p>

<p>Rescales the canvas as described above and draws the hidden or flipped tiles that are in play.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean isOver(Color[][] board)</code></p>

<p>Checks to see if all the matches have been found.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">double[] click()</code></p>

<p>Waits for a mouse to click and release and then returns an array with the click's x and y coordinates.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">void playGame()</code></p>

<p>Plays the game until it is over and then waits for a click to start a new one, at which point it generates a new board.</p>

<p>In this extension, you are going to need while loops that will run indefinitely, waiting for some input from the player. You <strong>must</strong> use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.pause(int msec)</code> method to give your computer a break. If you don't, the computer will waste resources doing absolutely nothing. Below is some sample code to demonstrate what this looks like:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	while(!StdDraw.mousePressed()) {  // waiting on a click
		StdDraw.pause(80);
	}
	// Do something...	
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don't forget that in order to actually run your game you will need a <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> method.</p>

<p>##Present Value</p>

<p>In this assignment, we consider and reason about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time value of money</a>.<br />
This is based on the observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While we live in the present, we understand the value of
  $1 in terms of what it can buy today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It's difficult for us to think of what a dollar
  could buy 100 years ago, or 100 years from now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to compare monetary values from several time periods,
  it is helpful to view them in the same time period.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The suggestion is therefore to reason about all currency in <em>today's dollars</em>.  This is called <em>present value</em>.</p>

<p>The ideas discussed here are widely used in economics, finanace, and
accounting.</p>

<p>##Two Friends and your $1
Suppose you have $1 and two friends who offer to take your dollar under the
following circumstances:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Friend One</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This friend takes your $1 
and gives you back $5 tomorrow.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Friend Two</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This friend takes your $1 and gives you 
back $10 in fifty years.</p>

<p>Which friend is offering you the better deal?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If we consider only the number of dollars you receive from these
  two friends, then in 50 years you end up with either $5, 
  or $10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may therefore seem that Friend Two is offering you the better deal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we know that $10 fifty years from now is 
  not worth $10 today.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>How do we reason about the value of $10 in fifty years?  We must first model
how the value of money changes over time.  We do this by choosing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a time period during which the money's value stays the same, and at the
end of which money grows instantaneously by some factor <em>r</em></p>

    <p>For this exercise, we choose a year's time, so that money changes
  value annually.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the factor <em>r</em>, which is interchangeably called
  the <em>discount rate</em>, <em>opportunity cost of capital</em>, and
  <em>rate of return</em>.</p>

    <p>For this exercise, we choose 10% growth so that 
  <em>r = 0.1</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We then use the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time value of money</a> 
to compute the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What would $1 be worth in fifty years if invested with some
  rate of return <em>r</em>?</p>

    <p>We model this computation by the function</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  futureValue(dollars, years, r) = dollars * (1.0 + r) ^ years
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Thus, $1 is the same now 
  as $117 dollars fifty years from now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much would I have to set aside today so that it would be worth
  $1 in fifty years using the discount
  rate <em>r</em>?</p>

    <p>We model this computation by computing the reverse (running time backwards)
  of what we computed for the future:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  presentValue(dollars, years, r) = dollars / (1.0 + r) ^ years
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Thus, to have $1 fifty years from now, we would have to set aside
  0.854 cents (less than one cent) now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Returning to your two friends, let's relate both friends' offers in terms
of present value, and compute your profit or loss (your <em>net</em> result).</p>

<p>##Net Present Value</p>

<p>Recall we assume a discount rate of 10% (<code class="highlighter-rouge">r=0.10</code>) and we regard
time annually.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Friend One</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This friend takes your $1 and gives 
  you back $5 tomorrow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With money changing
  value annually, $5 tomorrow 
  is the same as $5 today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Computing</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  presentValue(\$5, 0, 0.10) = \$5 / (1.0 + 0.10) ^ 0
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>yields $5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This friend's offer is therefore worth $5 today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <em>net</em> gain is the $5 you receive <em>minus</em> the $1 you gave 
  away, so you net $4.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Because your <em>net present value</em> from this deal is positive ($5), you would choose
to take advantage of this friend's offer.</p>

<p><strong>Friend Two</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This friend takes your $1 and gives 
  you back $10 in a fifty years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$10 in fifty years sounds 
  better than $5 tomorrow, but …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Computing</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  presentValue(\$10, 50, 0.10) = \$10 / (1.0 + 0.10) ^ 50
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>offer is worth about 8 cents today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <em>net</em> gain is the 0.08 dollars
  you receive minus the $1 you gave away, so you net −0.92 dollars.</p>

    <p>Because your <em>net present value</em> is negative (−0.92), you would decline
  this friend's offer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="product-development-story">Product Development Story</h2>

<p>Consider the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value#Example">example from Wikipedia</a>,
based on investing $100,000 to create a new product:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The product would cost you $100,000 to develop.  That money would be gone forever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every year for the next 12 years, you would receive $10,000 from sales
  of the product.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, you give away $100,000 and 
	you get $120,000 back.  Is this 
	a good deal?  Let's look at the returns in terms of Net Present Value (NPV):</p>
