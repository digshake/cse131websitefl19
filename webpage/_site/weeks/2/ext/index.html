<p>##Manipulating an Image Raster</p>

<p>In the <strong>imagetransforms</strong> package, modify the provided <strong>Transforms</strong> Java program
to implement the methods as described below.
Your methods will use iteration (either <strong>while</strong> loops or <strong>for</strong> loops) to operate on the pixels of a picture.</p>

<p>###Notes</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To run this extension, right (control) click on <strong>Main</strong> and choose <strong>Run as…</strong> then <strong>Java Application</strong>.</p>

    <p>This extension uses
  the same base code as the filter extension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Picture</strong> class is a Sedgewick class whose API is documented on page 720 of our text.
The coordinates are expressed using the standard in computer science graphics: 
the coordinate <em>(x,y)</em> denotes
the pixel that is</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>x</em> pixels to the right of the leftmost edge of the picture</li>
      <li><em>y</em> pixels down from the top edge of the picture</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, <em>(0,0)</em> is the top left corner of the picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pixel addressing follows the common Java convention:  if there are <em>w</em> horizontal pixels, then 0 is
the first (leftmost) and <em>w-1</em> is the last (rightmost).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost all of the methods are written in terms of two <strong>Picture</strong> parameters:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>source</strong>:  the picture to be used as input to your transformation</li>
      <li><strong>target</strong>:  the picture area to be used as output from your transformation</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There is just one exception:  the <strong>gradient</strong> method produces its output
without needing a source.  Its only parameter is
<strong>target</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each <strong>Picture</strong> has a width and a height, and these can be obtained
for a <strong>Picture p</strong> as follows:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  int width  = p.width();
  int height = p.height();
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To find the <strong>Color</strong> of a pixel at location <strong>x,y</strong>, you use</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Color c = source.get(x,y);</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To set the <strong>Color</strong> of a pixel at location <strong>x,y</strong> to the color <strong>c</strong>, you use</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">target.set(x,y,c);</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>##Instructions</p>

<p>Each of the methods described below is found in the <strong>Transforms</strong> class.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The provided method <strong>flipHoriz(Picture source, Picture target)</strong> flips the image horizontally.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../extensions/fliphoriz.png" alt="" /></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Look at the code given to you for this example
carefully.   It is broken into simple steps and the comments help explain why the pixel indexing works.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the method <strong>flipVert(Picture source, Picture target)</strong> that flips the image vertically.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../extensions/flipvert.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the method <strong>flipHorizLeftHalf(Picture source, Picture target)</strong> that flips the left half of the image horizontally.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The left half of the target image should be same as the source, but the right half of the target image should 
be the mirror of the left half of the source.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../extensions/fliplefthalf.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the method <strong>flipVertBotHalf(Picture source, Picture target)</strong> that flips the bottom half of the image vertically.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../extensions/flipbottomhalf.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the method <strong>gradient(Picture target)</strong> that takes a single <strong>Picture</strong>
as a parameter.</p>

    <p>Your code
 should create a <strong>color gradient</strong> by computing the following for each pixel:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The amount of red in each pixel increases gradually from 0 at the left edge of the image, to 255 at the right edge of the image.</li>
      <li>The amount of green in each pixel increases gradually from 0 at the top edge of the image, to 255 at the bottom edge of the image.</li>
      <li>The amount of blue in every pixel should be 128.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, each pixel will have a different color depending on its position.  For example, the pixel at the top left will have red=0, green=0, and blue=128.  The pixel about 1/4 of the way down on the right edge will have red=255, green=64, and blue=128.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Develop an expression
for the amount of red and green in each pixel, given the x and y position of that pixel and the width and height of the image:</p>

      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int amountRed   = .....</code>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">int amountGreen = ....</code></p>

      <p>Then set the pixel at <em>(x,y)</em> to a color based on those computations:</p>

      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">target.set(x, y, new Color(amountRed, amountGreen, 128));</code></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../extensions/gradient.png" alt="" /></p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In particular, performing

</blockquote>

<p>##Overview</p>

<p>In weight training, the volume of work completed in
one exercise (often called a <em>set</em>) is typically specified as a given weight that
is moved a specified number of times.  These are respectively
called the <em>weight</em> and <em>reps</em> (abbreviates repetitions)
of that set.</p>

<p>In this extension, you will create a one-rep max calculator. 
This calculator hypothetically calculates a weight that a subject
could move for one repetition, given that the same subject can successfully
complete <em>r</em> reps (in the range of
2 -&gt; 12) at a lighter weight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Beyond 12 reps,
the formula we use is not considered  accurate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The stated value for <em>r</em> is generally considered to be 
the number of times the weight
can be moved before <em>failure</em>:  the subject can complete <em>r</em> reps
at the stated weight, but no more.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While a person may never attempt that one-rep max movement, the one-rep 
max weight is canonical, in that it can then be used to compute
lighter weights that should be feasible for the subject at a desired number
of reps.</p>

<p>Your solution will compute and print:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The one-rep max weight based on a formula described below.</li>
  <li>The weight that should be feasible for a stated number of reps.</li>
  <li>Percentages of the one-rep max weight from 95% to 50% in decrements of 5%.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Example</p>

<p>Consider a subject who can successfully
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_press">bench</a>
225 pounds 10 times before failure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is this subjects current one-rep max bench weight?</li>
  <li>How much weight should that subject be able to bench to get 5 reps before failure?</li>
  <li>What percentage of this subject's max bench is the weight that can
be benched 5 times?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Input</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Successful weight:  225 pounds</li>
  <li>Successful reps: 10</li>
  <li>Desired reps:  5</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>One-rep max: 300
Weight for 5 reps: 255

<p>##Procedure</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First take a look at 
<a href="http://www.exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax.html">this one-rep max</a>
caculator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you try it for some sample values, you will see that it
produces results that may not work in an actual gym, because the smallest plate
one can find in most gyms is 2.5 pounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our calculator takes in a third input, which is how many reps the person 
wants to perform, 
and calculates a weight to be performed at that number of reps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">one-rep max</a>
calculations will be based on the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum#Epley_Formula">Epley Formula</a>,
so study that material sufficiently well to complete this extension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a <strong>OneRepMax</strong> class in the <strong>onerepmax</strong> package
of the <strong>extensions</strong> folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arrange for that program to prompt the user for the inputs needed for
this computation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute and print the results as shown in the sample ouptut above for
the inputs provided in the run of your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Check that the inputs provided are reasonable. Print a suitable message and
  exit if any inputs are unreasonable.</li>
      <li>Use iteration to produce the table of percentages of the one-rep max
  weight.</li>
      <li>Produce weight values that are rounded to the nearest <strong>5 pounds</strong>,
  so that the least weight needed on a bar is 2.5 pounds on each side.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

							<h2 id=3>Extension 2.3: Rock, Paper, Scissors (5 points)</h2>
							<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/">Ron Cytron</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors" title="RPS wiki">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> (hereafter, RPS) is a two-player game that can be used to avoid boredom and to settle disputes.</p>

<p>In this lab you will simulate two players: one plays randomly while
the other rotates faithfully from rock to paper to scissors. Your task is
to simulate this game and to report the fraction of games won by
each of the two players.</p>

<p>##Procedure
Find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RockPaperScissors</code> package in the labs source folder.
Create a new class <code class="highlighter-rouge">RPS</code> there, and you are ready to begin your development.</p>

<p>It is suggested that you develop code in small steps, so that you can proceed from confidence to confidence, and not have a big pile of untested code to debug at the end.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To help motivate this approach, the TAs will not help you unless you have shown progress based on these steps. Ask for help as soon as you need it, but please follow the steps below &gt; so that you can gain confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The steps you might consider are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What inputs does your program need? First, get your program to accept those inputs and print them out so you can see they are set properly.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This means that you should type in the code to prompt the user for the input(s), print out the values of those inputs, and that's all for now. Run your program at this point
and make sure it is behaving as you want.
What inputs do you need? There's no reason to ask for more than is necessary. At a minimum, you have to know how many rounds of RPS to play before printing the resulting
statistics</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, create a loop that simply iterates the desired number of times.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Again, run your program. You may want to print something out in your loop so you can
verify that the loop works correctly.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You next can make the concept of the random player real. This means declaring a variable name of a suitable type to represent this concept, establishing the variable's initial value.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>What is the concept of the player? There are many details about the
player that appear unnecessary: the player's name, address, cell phone number.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, if we are going to play RPS, we need to know what move the player &gt; has made. This is the important concept.</p>

      <p>How do we represent the choice of rock, paper, or scissors?
This is left up to you, so try for something simple. It may help to recall how Paul
Revere was <a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/PaulRevere%27sRide.html" title="The &gt; Midnight Ride of Paul Revere">(poetically)</a> told of how the British were coming: one if by land,
two if by sea.</p>

      <p>In otherwords, an <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code> encoded the manner of invasion.</p>

      <p>If there were only two choices, why didn't Paul use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean</code>?
Sadly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole" title="George Boole wiki">Bool</a>
was not yet born</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In your loop, you should modify this variable's value to reflect the associated player choosing randomly among rock, paper, and scissors each iteration.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You've seen how to use the random number generator to pick between two outcomes.
Now you must pick between three.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run your program and verify that the player is choosing randomly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OK, now for the other player. This player must cycle among rock, paper, and scissors. Let's make this player real by declaring a variable name of a suitable type and establishing its initial value.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In the interest of consistency and simplicity, you should use the same
encoding for this player in terms of what value means rock, what value means
paper, and what value means scissors.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In your loop, arrange for this player to choose its next move based on its previous move. If the move used to be rock, it's now paper. If the move used to be paper, it's now scissors. If the move was scissors, it's now rock.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run your program again and make sure the cycling player is behaving properly.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>To verify the cycling player's behavior, you will probably want to print out
the values representing that player's move each iteration.</p>

      <p>It won't take many iterations to see if this is working or not: 10 should do.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each player has made a move; now let's see who won. First, pick a name, type, and initial value for the number of wins a player has. Do the same for the other player.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Why do we need a variable to keep track of each player's wins?
Why not keep track of only one player's wins and assume the other player won the
other rounds?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the loop, determine who won based on the current value of each player's move.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors#Game_play" title="RPS Wiki">rules</a>
of RPS to adjudicate the winner,
and credit the win count properly.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the loop completes, report the fraction of wins awarded to each of the two players.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test your code by trying it with just one iteration, two iterations, and three iterations. Make sure it's working before you set it loose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run your code several times, each on 1000 iterations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on what you see, did one player tend to win more often than the other?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>##Background</p>

<p>In this assignment, you have a balance in your bank account and you randomly either deposit or withdraw money from 
your account every day for one month (30 days). At the end of the month, you receive interest on your balance.</p>

<p>##Procedure</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You start with $4000 in your bank account and earn 2% interest at the end of the month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each day, you always withdraw or deposit money. Half of the time you <strong>withdraw $100.00</strong> and the other 
half of the time you <strong>deposit $200.50</strong>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>How would you use random numbers to determine whether you withdraw or deposit money?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After withdrawing or depositing money, calculate your new balance. Then print the following: 
<strong>Day</strong>, <strong>Type</strong>, <strong>Amount</strong>, <strong>Balance</strong> in a cleanly formatted table.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Since the cent is the lowest denomination in U.S. currency, round your withdrawals, deposits, and balance 
to the nearest cent.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, after the 30th day, calculate and print the amount of interest you earned and your final balance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Your final output should look similar to this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Day	Type		Amount		Balance

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_(franchise)">Mario</a>, created in 1981 by Nintendo, is a classic video game 
starring the fictional Italian character Mario. In the assignment, 
loops printing hashtags will be used to build the block mountains as seen in the picture.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="../../../extensions/Super-Mario-Bros.-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Create Mountain Blocks in Mario using loops. Test all your loops on mountains of various sizes.</p>

<p>Hint: You many want to use underscores for spacing the blocks correctly before substituting spaces.</p>

<p>This can be accomplished by printing each line or character separately, or by 
adding all the spaces and hashtages to one large String. Using <strong>“\n”</strong> in a String causes a line break.
So, for example:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">String s = "one" + "\n" + "two";</code></p>

<p>prints out to:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">one</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">two</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a mountain that ascends to the right, as shown in the example for a size 5 mountain.</li>
