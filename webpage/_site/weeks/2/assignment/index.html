					<h1>Assignment 2: Game of Nim</h1>

<h1 id="game-of-nim">Game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">Nim</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">Nim</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_game">game of strategy</a> in which two players take turns removing sticks from a common pile. There are many variations of Nim
but for the purposes of this assignment, we will stick with a simple and common implementation. On each turn, a player must remove either 1 or 2 sticks
from the pile. The goal of the game is to be the player who removes the last stick.</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will design a game in which one human player is competing against a computer. The human player should also be able to decide
if he or she wants to play the first or second move.</p>

<p>It's important to note that while there <em>is</em> a winning strategy for this game, you are required only to implement a computer player which employs random moves.</p>

<p>Example output of one game:</p>

<pre>
Computer starts
Round 0, 7 sticks at start, computer took 2, so 5 sticks remain
Round 1, 5 sticks at start, human took 1, so 4 sticks remain
Round 2, 4 sticks at start, computer took 2, so 2 sticks remain
Round 3, 2 sticks at start, human took 1, so 1 sticks remain
Round 4, 1 sticks at start, computer took 1, so 0 sticks remain
Computer wins
</pre>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Begin by prompting the user for the initial number of sticks. In the example above, it appears that 7 sticks were used in the game.</li>
  <li>The computer (as always in this assignment) made the first move.</li>
  <li>Clearly, the human could have played better in the above game.</li>
  <li>The computer randomly removes 1 or 2 sticks, but cannot remove more sticks than are left.</li>
  <li>The human is prompted at each turn for how many sticks he or she wants to remove.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful!  A human might enter 5 if 5 sticks are left, and if you are not careful, the human could win by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating">playing</a> in that way.</p>

<p>Don't accept the user's input if it is illegal.  Continue prompting until you get a valid input.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start your work by creating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nim</code> class in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lab2</code> package..</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArgsProcessor</code> to prompt for inputs.</li>
  <li>Your program must continue play until somebody (computer or human) wins.</li>
  <li>Your output should resemble the sample output shown above.</li>
  <li>When you demo this assignment, be prepared to discuss how you would implement a dominant strategy with your TA</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submitting-your-work">Submitting your work</h1>

<p>To submit your work, contact the instructor or a TA. They will walk you through the submission process. Be prepared to show them the work that you have done and answer their questions about it!</p>
