					<h1 id="exercise-make-a-copy-of-an-array">Exercise: Make a copy of an array</h1>

<p>There are two parts to this exercise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First you will make a copy of an array.</li>
  <li>Then you will change your code so that as you copy, you create the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Pig Latin</a> version of 
each string from the original array.</li>
  <li>Find and open the <strong>CopyArraysAndPigLatin</strong> Java program in the <strong>exercises3</strong> package.</li>
  <li>Write code to make a copy of the provided <strong>names</strong> array.
We do this so that we can
make changes to the copy without affecting the original array.
If we call the copy array <strong>copy</strong>,  then the steps you take
are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Allocate the <strong>copy</strong> array with enough space to hold 
  each of the elements of <strong>name</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Do not use constants here:  pretend that the <strong>names</strong> array could
be of any length.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Iterate over the <strong>names</strong> array to assign each element of
  <strong>copy</strong> from <strong>names</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Check your results by iterating over <strong>copy</strong> and printing
each element.</li>
  <li>Now go back and cause each element of the <strong>copy</strong> array to have
the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Pig Latin</a> version of 
each string in the original <strong>names</strong> array.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="exercise-permuting-an-array">Exercise: Permuting an array</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Find and open the <strong>Shuffle</strong> Java program in the <strong>exercises3</strong> package.</li>
  <li>It declares an array of strings called <strong>original</strong> that 
contains the strings <strong>A</strong> through <strong>H</strong>, in alphabetical order.</li>
  <li>The goal of this exercise is to shuffle this array, or a copy of it
as you prefer, so at to obtain a randomized order of the strings.</li>
  <li>This is tricky, so try your best but donâ€™t feel bad if you need to
see the solution before you have it working completely.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can watch just enough of the solution video to get unstuck and then try
moving forward on your own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="exercise-multiplication-table">Exercise: Multiplication Table</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Find and open the <strong>TimesTable</strong> Java program in the <strong>exercises3</strong> package.</li>
  <li>Complete the class so it prints a table of products, as shown
on the introductory video.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your columns should line up nicely, assuming that all products take at most
2 digits.  In other words, it should look nice when given an input value of 9.
For greater values, your columns need not line up but the data should be
correct.</p>
