							<h2 id=1>Extension 3.1: Pascal's Triangle (3 points)</h2>
							<dl>
  <dt>Authors</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Robert Sedgewick (book)</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Take a look at the Wikipedia page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle">Pascal's Triangle</a>.  We will implement this using
a two-dimensional array, so it may be easier to imagine the entries left-justified rather than
in triangular form:</p>

<pre>
        column
        0  1  2  3  4
row
0       1
1       1  1
2       1  2  1
3       1  3  3  1
4       1  4  6  4  1
        .
        .
        .
</pre>

<p>Viewed as a two-dimensional array, the computation is specified
as follows, for each entry at row <em>r</em> and column <em>c</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If <em>c</em> is 0, then the entry is <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>.</li>
  <li>If <em>c</em><code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code><em>r</em>, then the entry is <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>.</li>
  <li>If <em>r</em><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;0</code> or <em>c</em><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;0</code> or <em>c</em><code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code><em>r</em>, then the entry is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> and is not shown.</li>
  <li>Everywhere else, the entry is computed as the sum of the entries at:
    <ul>
      <li><em>r</em><code class="highlighter-rouge">-1</code>,<em>c</em></li>
      <li><em>r</em><code class="highlighter-rouge">-1</code>,<em>c</em><code class="highlighter-rouge">-1</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>##Procedure</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PascalsTriangle</code> class, found in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">arrays</code> package of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insert code to obtain from the user the value <em>N</em> which is the number of rows you should compute of the triangle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instantiate the two-dimensional array needed to hold the results.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Java lets you do this as a <em>ragged</em> array, where each row can be of
a different length.</p>

      <p>You are welcome to instantiate the array that way, but
it is simpler and equally acceptable to instantiate the array with the same 
number of columns in each row.  Java syntax for that is <em>much</em> simpler.
An example of this appears in <code class="highlighter-rouge">SelfAvoidingWalk</code>,
found in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">book.ch1</code> package of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">book</code> source folder
in your repositories.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute the triangle as a two-dimensional array and print the results  left-justified as shown above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For extra fun, try to print the triangle centered as shown on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

							<h2 id=2>Extension 3.2: Data Sorting and Analysis (5 points)</h2>
							<dl>

<p>A big part of Computer Science revolves around finding ways
to sort data to be organized in a useful manner. There are many different algorithms
that computer scientists use to sort information. You can learn about a few popular ones below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort">Insertion Sort</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">Merge Sort</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quick Sort</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the purposes of this assignment,
we will implement our sorting using a naive process of repeatedly selecting the smallest value
from a data set of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">int[]</code>, and swapping it to the front of the collection. In computer science,
this is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">Selection Sort</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sorting</code> class, found in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">arrays</code> package
of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prompt the user for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">size</code> of the collection</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If the user enters a negative number, continue to prompt them with a useful message until they enter a positive number.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to prompt the user to input numbers one at a time, using an array to store the input data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After processing all of the numbers entered, the data will be sorted using the following naive algorithm:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an <code class="highlighter-rouge">int sortCount</code> to keep track of the number of times you've scanned the data
	&gt;</li>
        <li>
          <p>Create an outer loop to limit the number of scans to be equal to the size of the collection (<code class="highlighter-rouge">while(sortCount &lt; size)</code>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Create an inner loop to iterate over the unsorted portion of the array, each time selecting the minimum value (keep track of this value and its index in the array)</p>

          <p>The unsorted portion will always be the sub-array with indexes <code class="highlighter-rouge">sortCount</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">size</code> inclusive.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Swap this minimum value with the value currently at the head of the unsorted portion of the array</p>
        </li>
        <li>At this point, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sortCount</code> should be incremented to reflect the new unsorted portion of the array.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><img src="http://www.piratelearner.com/static/media/images/admin/2015/10/13/selection.gif" alt="" /></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the sorting the data, we will take advantage of its useful organization to compute the following statistics:</p>

    <p>Mean: The simple average of the data.</p>

    <p>Median: The middle value in the ordered dataset (Note: How does this computation vary for even and odd sized datasets?)</p>

    <p>Min: The smallest value in the ordered dataset.</p>

    <p>Max: The largest value in the ordered dataset.</p>

    <p>Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values of the data set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, arrange for your output to display the sorted dataset and accompanying statistics in the following manner:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> 1 2 3 4 5 
	
 Mean: 3.0
	
 Median: 3.0
	
 Min: 1
	
 Max: 5
	
 Range: 4
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

							<h2 id=3>Extension 3.3: Minesweeper (8 points)</h2>
							<dl>
  <dt>Authors</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/">Ron K. Cytron</a></dd>
</dl>

<p>You should see a <code class="highlighter-rouge">minesweeper</code> package in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> source folder.</p>

<p>This assignment is described in the book, exercise 1.4.30, on page 118.  Begin by reading that exercise to make sure you understand the task assigned to you for this lab.</p>

<p>You may find the exercise online <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/14array/"> here</a>, as Creative Exercise 30.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The file you will modify for this assignment is <code class="highlighter-rouge">MineSweeper.java</code>.  It is already in the respository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That file already prompts for the number of columns, rows, and the probability of a bomb.</p>

    <p>Do not change that part of the file.  The file is very clear about where you are to insert your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create the output as prescribed in the book's exercise.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">\*</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code> characters as shown in the book.  Otherwise, the visual version of this game (described below) will not work correctly.</p>

<p>Your output <strong>must</strong> include both the left and right parts of each line as described below.</p>

<p>The example given in the book is reproduced below:</p>

<pre>

* * . . .    * * 1 0 0
. . . . .    3 3 2 0 0
. * . . .    1 * 1 0 0

</pre>

<p>You must produce output that matches the form you see above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each line's <strong>left part</strong> displays the locations of the bombs (denoted by <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code>) and the non-bombs (denoted by <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each line's <strong>right part</strong> reports a <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> where there is a bomb and the count of bombs that border that cell where there is <em>not</em> a bomb.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The leftmost entry of the second row has no bomb.  In the left part of the second row, a dot is shown.  Its corresponding entry in the right part of the second row shows the number <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>, which is the sum of the bombs found on that cell's eight neighbors. Because this cell is left-most in the grid, some of its neighbors do not exist, but they are thus assumed to have no bombs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The mine field's central entry also has no bomb and shows a <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> in the right part of the output.   Those two bombs can be found in the upper-left and lower-left cells with respect to that center cell's eight neighbors.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The book provides a nice hint about an implementation that eliminates special cases around the edges of the field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">MineSweeper</code> as a Java Application and be sure your results look correct before you demo.</p>

    <p>Test on very small (say, 3x2) mine fields at first.  Enlarge the fields and test again, making certain the output is correct.</p>

    <p>Make sure it includes both the left and right parts of each line as described above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your program is complete (or, actualy, even prior to that), you can run a visual version of your game by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game</code> as a Java Application.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Our <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game</code> program runs your <code class="highlighter-rouge">MineSweeper</code> code, but hijacks the output for its own use.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The output you produce is therefore the <em>interface</em> between:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Your code that computes the maze, in particular, the location of bombs, and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The class-provided code that runs the visual version of the game.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>That class-provided code has tried to be tolerant of the output you might produce.  If it is not working for you, let us know.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>It builds a visual board based on your output.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It also shows the output you produced in the console window.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To play the visual version of the game:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Right-click on squares where you think there is a bomb.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Left-click on a square that has no bomb to show you the count of the number of bombs that border that square.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
