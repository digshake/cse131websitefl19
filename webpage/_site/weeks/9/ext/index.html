							<h2 id=1>Extension 9.1: More ListItem Methods -  the List Goes On (4 points)</h2>
							<p>##Procedure</p>

<p>In the file <strong>ListItem.java</strong>, write <strong>static</strong> methods
that satisfy the following specifications.  Remember that static methods are called directly on the ListItem class itself, rather than on ListItem objects.</p>

<p><strong>Create JUnit tests to test each method thoroughly.</strong></p>

<p>Recall that to call static methods of the ListItem class from your JUnit test methods, you can specify the class name each time, as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListItem.evenElements(ls)</code>.  Alternatively, you can save characters and just write <code class="highlighter-rouge">evenElements(ls)</code> if you import the static methods from the ListItem class by adding the line</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">import static lab9.ListItem.*;</code></p>

<p>near the top of your file, after the package declaration.</p>

<p>As you work through these exercises, be sure to use recursion or iteration as indicated.  Where not indicated, you may choose either approach.  Each method will take references to list items as
parameters. Unless otherwise specified, <strong>you should handle the case of a null parameter value.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>recursive</strong> static procedure <code class="highlighter-rouge">pairwiseSum</code></p>

    <pre>
 PARAMETERS:   two ListItem references, ls1 an ls2
 RETURN VALUE: a ListItem at the front of a new list containing the pairwise
               sum of the elements in ls1 and ls2
                  for example, given lists ( 3 2 6 ) and ( 1 4 2), 
                  the return value would be the list ( 4 6 8 )
 </pre>
    <p>You may assume that the given lists are the same length.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <strong>iterative</strong> static procedure <code class="highlighter-rouge">smallElements</code></p>

    <pre>
 PARAMETERS:   a ListItem reference, ls
               an integer n
 RETURN VALUE: a new list identical to the given list, except
               that it contains no occurrences of numbers greater than n.
               for example, given input list ( 3 2 6 3 4 ) and 3,
                  the return value would be the list ( 3 2 3 )
 </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <strong>iterative</strong> static procedure <code class="highlighter-rouge">scale</code></p>

    <pre>
 PARAMETERS:   a ListItem reference, ls
               an integer n
 RETURN VALUE: none (void)
               the procedure **mutates** the list by multiplying
               each number in the list by the given number n.
                  for example, given input lists ( 3 2 6 3 4) and
                  the number 3,
                  the modified list would be ( 9 6 18 9 12 ).
 </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A static procedure <code class="highlighter-rouge">insertAfter</code></p>

    <pre>
 PARAMETERS:   a ListItem reference, ls
               two integers i and j (not equal)
 RETURN VALUE: none (void)
               the procedure **mutates** the list by inserting the
               given number i after each occurrence of j.
                  for example, given input lists ( 3 2 6 3 4) and
                  the number 5 and 3,
                  the modified list would be ( 3 5 2 6 3 5 4 ).
 </pre>

    <p>Be sure to do this by creating new list items only for the inserted numbers.  Modifying the <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code> references in the existing ListItem objects to insert the new items in the right places. Don't create a whole new list structure.</p>
  </li>

							<h2 id=2>Extension 9.2: Reversing Lists (3 points)</h2>
							<p>In the ListItem class, write methods with the following specifications,
and write thorough JUnit tests to check that they work correctly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>recursive</strong> method <code>reverseRecurse</code> that takes no parameters and returns a ListItem.  The return value should be a <strong>new</strong> list structure that contains the same numbers as this list, but in the reverse order.  (Hint: Use a helper procedure with an extra parameter that accumulates the reversed list.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <strong>iterative</strong> method <code>reverseLoop</code> that takes no parameters and returns a ListItem.  The return value should be a <strong>new</strong> list structure that contains the same numbers as this list, but in the reverse order. (Hint: Create a loop variable that's a ListItem reference to keep track of your current position in the list.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

							<h2 id=3>Extension 9.3: Falling Arches (12 points)</h2>
							<p>##Overview:
Computers are powerful problem-solving tools, and simulation is a common technique foranalyzing systems whose behavior is beyond the capabilities of simple models or closed formulae. Weather prediction and fluid flow are examples of such systems.  In the work described here, you will simulate the shape of a suspended cable by constructing the cable from masses and springs and allowing gravity and the laws of Newtonian physics to act upon the masses.</p>

<p>More specifically, you construct a model for simulating the shape of a <strong>catenary</strong>:  the shape of our beloved St. Louis <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch">Gateway Arch</a>.</p>

<p>##Goals:</p>

<p>By the end of this extension, you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gain more experiences with arrays and lists</li>
  <li>Gain more experience with iteration</li>
  <li>Understand the nature of simulation and approximation in computation science</li>
</ul>

<p>##Before starting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read over this entire document before you start.</li>
  <li>Ask questions of the instructor and TAs.</li>
</ul>

<p>##Problem description:</p>

<p>Long before our city began its expansion into the NFL, the pioneers of our country expanded to the West, crossing the Mississippi and braving the perils of midwestern life.  As a monument to their efforts, the City of St. Louis erected <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Eero+Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a>'s famous <a href="http://www.gatewayarch.com/Arch/info/arch.fact.aspx">Arch</a> in 1965.  Its grace, beauty, and elegance have inspired poets, musicians, and artists of the past five decades.</p>

<p>It's time that CSE131 had its turn.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary">catenary</a> is the shape made when you suspend a string by holding its ends, and let gravity pull on the string. If you look at a telephone wire strung between two poles, the shape you see is a catenary, though not one that would necessarily garner artistic praise.</p>

<p>It turns out that our Arch is also a catenary, but situated upside down.</p>

<p>How are we to simulate an catenary acting on a string?  If we look really closely at the string, we see that it is composed of a series of mass points, with each adjacent pair of masses connected by a spring.</p>

<p>With gravity turned off, the picture is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/orig2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the simulation proceeds, the catenary takes on the following shapes:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/100.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/300.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/final.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>##Notes</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You are given an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArchController</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Arch</code> class to facilitate your
running this program as a GUI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your effort goes into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Arch</code> class, specifically:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The constructor must set up the simulation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">round()</code> method must simulate one round of gravity and springs acting on each mass.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can use any data type to represent the masses and/or springs. Wisely you must choose, young padawan, for this choice will affect how much work you will have to put in for the remainder of this extension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To obtain consistent results, it is suggested that you simulate movement in two phases within a given round:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>First compute where each mass should move at the end of this round, but do not move them. This way, the other mass's positions are computed consistently.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once the new position of all masses are known, have each mass move to its new position.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>It is preferred that you do not account for the momentum of the masses. In the real world, when the masses fall, if they are held  together by springs, they would bounce up and down until eventually the springs turn the kinetic energy of the masses into heat through internal friction. In this code, even if you account for momentum AND friction, it is very hard to get the masses to settle. So instead, for every <code class="highlighter-rouge">round()</code> calculate where the mass should be based on the force of gravity and the springs, and move it there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of the resolution of this project in terms of the number of  masses that are used in the simulation. Make sure that the sum  of the masses is constant, no matter how many masses you use, so that the cable has constant total mass no matter how many point masses (rectangles in the picturse) you use in the simulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A spring obeys <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hook's Law</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To receive credit, you must be able to change certain properties of the simulation.  See the list of questions below for more detail, and be sure to parameterizse your simulation so that these are easily changed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>##To receive credit</p>

<p>Be prepared to answer the following questions when you demo:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What happens when the spring constant is large?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do the masses continue to wiggle, even after the Arch seems finished?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens when you have more masses, but the same gravity and spring constant?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens when gravity increases?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Extra fun:</strong> Modify your solution so that the Arch starts at the bottom of the screen, and falls up instead of down.</p>

							<h2 id=4>Extension 9.4: Trees and a Map ADT (10 points)</h2>
							<p><em>Note:</em>  This extension is especially recommended for those students who wish to continue with computer science studies.  Others are welcome to complete it as well.</p>

<p>Update your repository as usual to get the <code class="highlighter-rouge">trees</code> package in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> folder.</p>

<p>##Two implementations of a Map interface</p>

<p>In this lab, you will implement a <em>map</em> abstract data type two different ways.  Both of the implementations will provide the same functionality, but will differ in their structure and efficiency.</p>

<p>Think of a “map” ADT as a relation between a <em>domain</em> and a <em>range</em>.  For example, a telephone directory is a map from names to telephone numbers.  The domain is all possible names, and the range is all possible phone numbers.  As another example, this kind of data structure could be useful, for example, to map stock names to their current prices in a stock trading application.  Each entry in the map is a pair of elements, one from the domain and one from the range. Often, the domain and range are different types, but that is not a requirement.  The test cases for this lab will map strings to integers, but your implementations should be able to handle any data types.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One purpose of this lab is for you to learn how to design and implement different data structures.  Therefore, <strong>do not</strong> use any of the data structures that are already provided by Java in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">java.util</code> package.  Build your data structures from scratch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To compare objects, such as String values, use the <strong>provided</strong>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">compareTo</code> method of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">Comparable</a> interface.   For String values,
this method uses lexicographic ordering (dictionary ordering); the <code class="highlighter-rouge">compareTo</code> method takes as its parameter another String, and returns an integer whose value is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>negative if this string is less than the parameter,</li>
      <li>zero if this string is equal to the parameter, or</li>
      <li>positive if this string is greater than the parameter.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do not use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code> operator to compare objects for equality.</strong> When <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code> is used on objects, it evaluates to true if both sides of the comparison refer to the same exact memory location (i.e., it's the exact same object).  For example, even if two String objects contain the same text, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code> test for equality on the two objects would return <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> if they are not the same object.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>##Directions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the provided file <strong>Map.java</strong> and study the provided code in that file.  Notice that the file does not contain a class definition, but instead contains an <em>interface</em>.  Recall that an interface is just a collection of method names with parameter types and return types.  It cannot be instantiated, because it doesn't actually contain implementations of any of the methods.  That is, the methods have no bodies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the provided file <strong>OrderedListMap.java</strong> and read the provided code.  Notice the line</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">public class OrderedListMap&lt;K extends Comparable&lt;K&gt;,V&gt; implements Map</code></p>

    <p>near the top of the file.  The phrase “implements Map” means that this class conforms to the Map interface.  In other words, this class must define all of the methods contained in the Map interface, and the compiler will check that this is indeed the case.</p>

    <p>Notice also that the key type <code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code> is any <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comparable</code> object. This will allow you to call the <code class="highlighter-rouge">compareTo</code> method on the keys. The values associated with key can be objects of any type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, Java's support for interfaces provides the power to define the interface of an ADT and write programs in terms of that interface.  Then, you can implement the ADT in different ways and use those implementations interchangably. For example, look at the testAllMethods procedure in the provided file <strong>MapTest.java</strong>. Notice that the method calls another method to create a Map object. Any object returned by that method must implement the Map interface, and so the testAllMethods procedure may call any of the methods in the Map interface on the object returned. There are two other JUnit test cases provided, one for OrderedListMap and one for TreeMap.  Each of these <em>extends</em> the MapTest and so each of them <em>inherits</em> testAllMethods.  Each of these test cases <em>overrides</em> the method that creates the Map, to create an OrderedListMap and a TreeMap, respectively. So, when you run each of those test cases, they will use the same test method, but will use different type of object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Study again the interface definition in the file <strong>Map.java</strong>, paying attention to the documentation for each method.</p>

    <p>Complete the implementation in the file <strong>OrderedListMap.java</strong>, being sure to satisfy the specification given in the interface file. For your internal representation, use a linked list, where each list item contains a domain element (e.g., a <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>), a range element (e.g., an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Integer</code>), and a next pointer (to another list item).  If you like, you can use dummy nodes at the beginning and end of the list. Also, feel free to create a doubly linked list (with previous pointers) if you find that easier.</p>

    <p>One of the representation invariants for your OrderedListMap implementation should be that the list is kept in alphabetically sorted order according to the domain element. Use the fact that the list is kept in sorted order in order to improve the efficiency of the methods.</p>

    <p>You can write additional test cases, but when you are finished, the provided test case <code class="highlighter-rouge">OrderedListMapTest</code> should run correctly. Also, be sure to verify that your toString methods produce the correct output. Verify that your list is being kept in sorted order.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the implementation in the file <strong>TreeMap.java</strong>, being sure to satisfy the specification given in the interface file. To do this, you'll need to define a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TreeNode</code> class. Each node in the tree will have a domain element, a range element, a (possibly null) left subtree and a (possibly null) right subtree. Your implementation should satisfy the representation invariant that for each node, all strings in the left subtree are alphabetically less, and all strings in the right subtree are alphabetically greater. Make use of this invariant to improve the efficiency of the methods.</p>

    <p>Your <code class="highlighter-rouge">remove</code> method will require deleting elements from the tree. The usual way to delete nodes from a binary search tree is somewhat complicated, as discussed in class.  Therefore, we are leaving the proper implementation of delete as an optional extension for this lab. If you don't want to do that extension, then you can implement delete by adding a boolean instance variable called <code class="highlighter-rouge">deleted</code> to your tree nodes.  If you delete an element from the tree, you can just set <code class="highlighter-rouge">deleted</code> to true.  Then, when a search reaches that node for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">get</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">contains</code> method, you can act as if the element is not in the tree.</p>

    <p>Implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">toString</code> method so that it returns a readable representation of the tree. Display the tree sideways, with the root of the tree at the left edge of the page. Your return String should have one node per line, something like this:</p>

    <pre>

                         (quack,4)
             (oink,5)
                         (moo,7)
 (meow,2)
                         ()
             (bow wow,8)
                         (baa,5)

 </pre>

    <p>This is called an * in-order traversal* of the tree, since one subtree is traversed first, then the node itself, and then the other subtree. You can use the special character <code class="highlighter-rouge">\'\n\'</code> in a String to cause the terminal to advance to a new line as it prints the string.</p>

    <p>Hint: The depth of the node in the tree determines how much to indent. So, use a helper procedure with a String parameter that keeps track of the leading spaces for each line of output.  Start it out with the value <code class="highlighter-rouge">""</code> and then concatenate a String of spaces to create the indentation String parameter for the recursive calls on both subtrees. If you want, you can use the special tab character <code class="highlighter-rouge">\'\t\'</code> instead of multiple spaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can write additional test cases, but when you are finished, the provided test case TreeMapTest should run correctly. Also, be sure to verify that your toString methods produce the correct output. Verify that your list is being kept in sorted order. Look at the printed values to be sure that the representation invariant is being preserved by your implementation.</p>
  </li>

  <li>If <strong>x</strong> is a leaf, let <strong>x</strong>'s parent refer to null instead.</li>
