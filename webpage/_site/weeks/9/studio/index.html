  <li>All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work</li>
  <li>Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.</li>
  <li>Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard. Before doing so, <strong>commit your work</strong> to make sure your work is saved</li>

<p>##Doubly Linked Lists</p>

<p>In lecture this week, we implemented an <code class="highlighter-rouge">IntList</code> interface using lists with one link per item. In this studio, you will investigate implementation of our <code class="highlighter-rouge">IntList</code> ADT using a doubly linked list.  Your work will include design and implementation of iterators (forwards and backwards) for the list, and a discussion that compares your implementation with the singly linked list from lecture.</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Gather your group around one workstation.  Plan on taking turns at the keyboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review the <a href="../../../studios/26.pdf">studio prep material</a> on doubly linked lists. Keep that material open on somebody's display for reference during the studio.</p>

    <p>Note:  The "null" in the sentinel nodes should really be "any integer you like because it will be ignored". In other words, the sentinels should also be <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListItem</code> objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code developed during lecture is in your studio workspace.  Look in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">studio9</code> package of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">studios</code> source folder.</p>

    <p>The code you should probably study is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SinglyLinkedListWithSentinel</code> class, since it uses sentinels and so does this studio. This code is in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">studio9</code> package.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examine the provided <code class="highlighter-rouge">IntList</code> interface.</p>

    <p>Please follow the instructions below carefully.  Don't try to skip ahead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now let's start a new class in this package, <code class="highlighter-rouge">DoublyLinkedListOfInts</code>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Click on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">studio9</code> entry in the package explorer.</li>
      <li>Click: File..New..Class</li>
      <li>Fill in the name (<code class="highlighter-rouge">DoublyLinkedListOfInts</code>)</li>
      <li>In the Interfaces section, Add the IntList interface (you have to type this in, but as you do, the one you want will appear as a choice).</li>
      <li>Be  sure the <em>Inherit abstract methods</em> box is checked.</li>
      <li>Finish it up</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should now have stubs in your new class. If you do not, delete the new class and start again, following the instructions carefully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">DoublyLinkedListOfInts</code> <em>has-a</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code> pointer, just as we have in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SinglyLinkedListWithSentinel</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">tail</code> pointer, which points to the other sentinel, at the <em>end</em> of the list</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">size</code>, which reflects the number of <em>bona fide</em> integers in this list.  In other words, the sentinels are not included in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">size</code> count.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Declare instance variables to represent these <em>has-a</em>s in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">DoublyLinkedListOfInts</code> class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each method in the interface, discuss an implementation and sketch how it would work:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>More details are provided below, but you should first talk about this.</li>
      <li>As you work, look for opportunities to reduce one method's work to another's.</li>
      <li>One of the most important aspects of this design is the use of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_node">sentinel</a>, as depicted in the <a href="../../../studios/26.pdf">studio prep material</a>. Discuss the role of sentinels and how they affect (simplify) your implementation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For testing, I've included a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestLinkedListOfObjects</code> jUnit test you can use as-is to test your code. Notice the declarations of the interface type (<code class="highlighter-rouge">IntList</code>) as compared with the actual objects instantiated (<code class="highlighter-rouge">LinkedListOfInts</code>).</p>

    <p><strong>Use the interface type as much as possible. It does not commit to an implementation and this makes it easier to change from one implementation of the interface to another.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListItem</code> class, as given to you and as used in lecture, had only one pointer, namely <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code>.  For the doubly linked list, you need to augment <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListItem</code> to have two pointers: ` next<code class="highlighter-rouge"> and </code>prev`.</p>

    <p>Add the necessary instance variable, accessors and setters to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ListItem</code> class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work on implementing the methods as we did in class, in the following order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Constructor - like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">LinkedListOfInts</code> but it will have to initialize the <code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">tail</code> sentinels as well.  Can those instance variables be <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code>?</li>
      <li>Your constructor must create the objects and pointers that are shown on <strong>slide 2</strong> of the <a href="../../../studios/26.pdf">studio prep material</a>.</li>
      <li>It's usually a good idea to assume initially that instance variables could be <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code> and then retreat from that if necessary.</li>
      <li>DO NOT MOVE ON until you have shown your constructor to your TA so we can be sure you see how this object is supposed to be initialized.  It's important to understand that before moving to the methods below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">String toString() </code> - you might want to implement this first, so you can use it for debugging by printing out the state of the list.</p>

    <p>A good way to think of this is to look at <strong>slide 1</strong> of the <a href="../../../studios/26.pdf">studio prep material</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">void addFirst(int item)</code> - be sure to think about special cases, such as adding to an empty list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">void addLast(int item)</code> - recall in the studio prep material, there is not only a <code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code> pointer, but also a <code class="highlighter-rouge">tail</code> pointer.  Try to do this operation as efficiently and cleanly as you can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int size()</code> - remember that this returns the perceived size of the list, in terms of how the end-user views the list.  The sentinels do not count toward the size.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">int indexOf(int item)</code> - should return -1 if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">item</code> is not found. Otherwise it should return the first occurence of the item in the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean remove(int item)</code>  tries to remove the first occurence of the item, if any. The method returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> if something was removed, <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> otherwise.</p>

    <p><strong>Try to use the sentinels and double links to your advantage.   This method is quite easy because of those.</strong> Strive for the cleanest, correct implementation.  Talk with others and other groups about ideas for doing this.</p>

    <p>If you get this far, that's great.  You may find the rest challenging, but give it a try for the time you have left.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; iterator()</code> will take some thought. Here are some ideas.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It will not work to keep the state of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Iterator</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DoublyLinkedListOfInts</code> class.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's really important that you understand why the above is true.  Discuss this amongst yourselves and talk with a TA about it.  Do not move on until your group sees this point.  Think of what would happen with two nested iterators if you had the state in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DoublyLinkedLIstOfInts</code> object.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You can use extra classes if you need them.  Just add them into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lists</code> package and use them however you like.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This method must return an instance of an object that "implements" all of the methods in the `Iterator<Integer> interface:</Integer></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean hasNext()</code>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Integer next()</code>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">void remove()</code> - for this method, do nothing, just have a stub that is empty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">IntList reverse()</code> returns a new list with the elements in the reverse order of <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> list.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
