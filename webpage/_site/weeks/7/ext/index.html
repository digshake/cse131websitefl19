<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> is a biology simulation that was developed by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is designed to simulate cellular automation by creating an initial configuration of living and dead cells and observing how they evolve. Many interesting patterns have developed from the origins of the original simulation–producing patterns that pulsate, exist into infinity, and even glide like spaceships.</p>

<p>The rules of Conway's Game of life are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a living cell has fewer than two living neighbors, it dies of loneliness</li>
  <li>If a living cell has more than three living neighbors it dies of overcrowding</li>
  <li>If a living cell has two or three neighbors, it continues to live</li>
  <li>If a dead cell has exactly three living neighbors, it is resurrected by friendship</li>
</ul>

<p>This set of rules can end up making some very interesting patterns. Below we have drawn out some of the patterns that are made by cells in Conway's game of life. Dead cells are represented by white squares, living cells are represented by black squares.</p>

<p>##Directions</p>

<p>In this extension, you will be responsible for building the simulator portion of Conway's Game of Life (henceforth known as Conway, or Life). You can then run the game on your own patterns or on patterns that we provide.</p>

<p>The code for this work can be found <code class="highlighter-rouge">conway</code> package of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> source folder. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Conway</code> class is where you will be doing all of your work. <code class="highlighter-rouge">ConwayTest</code> is the tester for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Conway</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Main</code> is what you will run when your code is finished to actually see your work happen. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Main</code> class creates a GUI, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface</a>, which allows you to see cells dying and coming back to life. Open <code class="highlighter-rouge">Conway</code>. You will create the following methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">public Conway(int rows, int cols)</code> constructor that specifies the dimensions of the Conway board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">public int getRows()</code> method, that is an accessor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">public int getColumns()</code> method, that is an accessor</p>

    <p>Your code should now pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getRowsAndColumnsTest()</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">public void setLiveness(boolean b, int row, int col)</code> method that takes in a row and a column, and whether that cell should be currently alive or dead</p>

    <p>It would make sense that if a cell was alive, and it was represented by a boolean, it would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>, and if it was dead it would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>. You must come up with a data type that stores values in rows an columns to represent all of the cells. There are multiple ways to store this information, but think carefully about which one you choose, for this choice could save you time down the road. Just remember; you should not change anything within the test, and you must return what we ask you to return.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <code class="highlighter-rouge">public boolean isAlive(int row, int col)</code> method, which returns whether the cell at that specific row and column is alive or dead. If the row and column are out of the bounds of that Conway object, then return false.</p>

    <p>Your code should now pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">isAliveTest()</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">setLivenessTest()</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">public void clear()</code> method, which sets every cell in the Conway object to dead.</p>

    <p>Your code should now pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">clearTest()</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">public int countLivingNeighbors(int row, int col)</code> method, which considers the cell at a certain row and column, and returns the number of living neighbors that it has.</p>

    <p>The neighbors of a certain cell are considered to be the eight cells that are surrounding it. Your <code class="highlighter-rouge">isAlive()</code> should help you with this.</p>

    <table>
 <tr><td><img src="../../../extensions/3by3box.gif" /> </td><td>If you were to count the number of living neighbors of the living cell in the picture above, you would check the eight white squares that are surrounding it, and see if any of those cells were alive. In this picture, the live cell in the middle has no living neighbors, so according to the rules, it will die of loneliness. So in the next frame it will become a white square. </td></tr>
 <tr><td><img src="../../../extensions/4x4BoxFilled.gif" /></td>
 <td>This is a random group of cells</td>
 </tr>
 <tr><td><img src="../../../extensions/4x4BoxNumbers.gif" /></td>
 <td>This picture shows the number of living neighbors that each of the cells in the above picture has </td>
 </tr>
 </table>

    <p>Once you implement this method, your code should pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">countLivingNeighborsTest()</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">public void step()</code> method, which executes a generation of life. What this means is that you take all of the cells from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> Conway object, and determine whether or not they will be alive in the next generation.</p>

    <p>It might be helpful here to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code> conway object with the same dimensions as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> Conway object. If you change the values of the original Conway object while you still havent determined whether other cells will be alive in the next generation, you might not count the wrong number of living neighbors. For instance, say cell A and cell B both alive, and are neighbors. If you determine that A will be dead in the next generation, and you kill it, when you go to count the number of living neighbors of B, it will have fewer living neighbors now than it should. If you create another Conway object, you can store the liveness of ALL of the cells on that Conway object, and then alter the values of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> Conway object at the end.</p>

    <p>If a cell will not be alive in the next generation, set it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>. If a cell will be alive in the next generation, set it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>. Make sure to account for all cells, and not just the ones that are currently alive. The rules of the Conway Game of Life are listed at the top of this page. This is where you will implement those rules.</p>

    <p>Your code should now pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">stepTest()</code></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the code, we have <code class="highlighter-rouge">public void yourDesginOne()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">public void yourDesginTwo()</code>. You
 do not have to fill these out for the code to work, but if you want to create a pattern, you can create it here, and 
 you will be able to access it through the GUI. These will be used for the next extension</p>

<p>The following methods are provided for you, do not change any of these:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">public void blinker()</code> allows the GUI to create a blinker pattern</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">public void fourBlinkers()</code> allows the GUI to create a four-blinker pattern</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">public void gosperGliderGun()</code> allows the GUI to create a gosperGliderGun pattern</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">public void glider()</code> allows the GUI to create a glider pattern</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other supporting classes, including the visualization code, are in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">labsupport</code> source folder.  They are moved there to reduce the clutter in the extensions folder.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There is also an empty <code class="highlighter-rouge">public void logAndCapture()</code> method. You do not need to put anything in here right now, 
this is the subject of the next extension</p>

<p>Once you have completed all the methods, you can run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Main</code> method to play Conway's Game of Life.</p>

<p>To further debug your code, the visual interface allows you to take one step
at a time. If the game is not working, use the debugger or print information helpful to
diagnosing the problems you see.</p>

<p>###To Demo</p>

<p>Your code must pass all of the unit tests, and the GUI should work, and be able to display cells interacting with eachother.</p>

							<h2 id=2>Extension 7.2: Conways Game of Afterlife - Automatic generation (3 points)</h2>
							<p>For this extension, you will be working with automatic code generation, which will save you time and energy if you want to save any of the cell mappings you create in Conway. In order to get credit for this extension, you  must implement the functionality of <code class="highlighter-rouge">logAndCapture()</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Conway</code> to capture the current living cells you have on the board and generate the appropriate Java code for creating those cells in the console.</p>

<p>For example, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Four Blinkers</code> code is captured already, but if you were to generate code for it using <code class="highlighter-rouge">logAndCapture()</code> the result would look something like this:</p>

<pre>
		Beginning of Log and Capture
		setLiveness(true, 1, 1);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 2);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 3);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 5);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 6);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 7);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 1);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 2);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 3);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 5);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 6);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 7);
		End of Log and Capture
</pre>

<p>The idea is that the code can be copied from the console, pasted into your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Conway</code> class, and when you choose the right menu item from the interface, the board will be initialized to replicate what you captured.</p>

<p>Once you have <code class="highlighter-rouge">logAndCapture()</code> working, use this new tool to automatically generate your own Conway patterns in <code class="highlighter-rouge">myDesignOne()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">myDesignTwo()</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">myDesignThree()</code>. For credit for this extension, these patterns should be both intriguing and potentially time-consuming to generate by hand.</p>

  </dd>
</dl>

<p>##Procedure</p>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">matrix</code> package of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> source folder, implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code> class. Every time you implement a method correctly, you will be able to pass one more unit test. We have provided and finished some methods. We ask that you do not change anything other than the methods listed below. Implement the methods with the following features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>constructor</em> that takes a two-dimensional array of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> and saves it (as an instance variable) as the values of the matrix.</p>

    <p>To be safe, your instance variable must be a <em>copy</em> of the parameter, so that the contents of your Matrix's array cannot be changed beyond your control.</p>

    <p>To copy the two-dimensional array, you must instantiate a new two-dimensional array and copy the original array's contents into your new array. Do not use <code class="highlighter-rouge">clone</code>. It will only clone the first row of the array, and the rest of the rows will be left empty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <code class="highlighter-rouge">arraysAreEqual(double[][] one, double[][] two)</code> method that compares the two arrays to see if they are the same.  The two arrays are the same if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They agree in the size of both of their dimensions.</li>
      <li>The contents of the two arrays are the same.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">.equals(Object)</code> method included with this lab calls your <code class="highlighter-rouge">arraysAreEqual</code> method, so that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code> equality of two matrices depends on the contents of those matrices.</p>

    <p>Until this method is working, the rest of the JUnit tests will not work properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">toString</code> method that neatly shows the contents of the matrix. In your string use "\n" to insert a line break, and use "\t" where you want a tab between elements. Include JUnit tests that print these strings to the console (using <code class="highlighter-rouge">System.out.println</code>) for visual inspection, in addition to any automated tests you perform. Your toString method will come in handy for debugging the other methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">scaleRow</code> method that takes a row number (an integer) and a scale factor (a double), and multiplies that row by the given scale factor.  This method does not return anything.  It just modifies the matrix.</p>

    <p>In this lab, rows are numbered as arrays are indexed.  Thus, the top row in the matrix is row 0, and the bottom row is numbered one less than the number of rows in the matrix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <code class="highlighter-rouge">addRows</code> method that takes two row numbers as parameters, and adds the two rows together, storing the result in place of the second of the two rows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">plus</code> method that takes another Matrix as its parameter and returns the matrix that results from adding this matrix by the given one. Matrix addition is only valid when the two matrices are the same size in both dimensions, so your <code class="highlighter-rouge">plus</code> method should throw an IllegalArgumentException when this is not the case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">transpose</code> method that takes no parameters and returns a new matrix that is the transpose of this one.  Recall that the columns of the transposed matrix have the same values as the rows of the original matrix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">times</code> method that takes another Matrix as its parameter and returns the matrix that results from multiplying this matrix by the given one. Recall that when you multiply two matrices A and B, the value in the cell at row <em>r</em> and column <em>c</em> of the resulting matrix is the dot product of A's row <em>r</em> with B's column <em>c</em>. Also recall that matrix multiplication is only valid when the number
of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second, so your <code class="highlighter-rouge">times</code> method should throw an IllegalArgumentException when this is not the case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <code class="highlighter-rouge">exchangeRows</code> method that takes in two rows i and j and exchanges the two. This modifies the matrix and does not return anything.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>##To Demo</p>

<p>Your code must pass all of the unit tests.</p>

							<h2 id=4>Extension 7.4: Gaussian Elimination (6 points)</h2>
							<p>##Procedure</p>

<p>###Overview</p>

<p>Note: This assignment can only be completed after completing the previous “Project: Matrix” extension.</p>

<p>You will create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gaussian</code> class in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">matrix</code> package. Inside of it you will have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">public Matrix getSolution()</code> method that solves a series of equations by Gaussian elimination as described in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>###Directions</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a constructor in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gaussian</code> class that takes in two <code class="highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code>es, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code>x<code class="highlighter-rouge">n Matrix</code> that represents the coefficients in the set of equations, and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code>x1 <code class="highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code> that represents the constants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write a <code class="highlighter-rouge">getSolution()</code> method that takes an instance of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gaussian</code> object and finds and returns the solution of the system of equations that it represents. As the article describes, you must achieve this by exchanging, scaling, and adding rows until the coefficients <code class="highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix" target="new">the identity matrix</a>. Remember that every time you perform one of those operations, you must do it to both <code class="highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code>es. You will then return the updated constants <code class="highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code>.</p>

    <p>HINT: try working on the bottom-left side of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code> first. Once you get it in echelon form, working on the top-right side is very similar.</p>

    <p>You can assume that there will only be one solution to the system of equations that we provide to you.</p>

    <p>NOTE: Your solution to this extension must be a general one. In other words, it cannot be restricted to solving 3x3 (or 3x4 if you count the sums column) matrices. It must be able to solve systems of equations with arbitrary numbers of parameters, provided that the length and width of the coefficients matrix equal the length of the sums matrix and the width of the sums matrix equals one.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>###To Demo
You must pass the <code class="highlighter-rouge">GaussianElimination</code> unit test.</p>

							<h2 id=5>Extension 7.5: Objects to Support Music (9 points)</h2>
							<p>##Overview:</p>

<p>There are several extensions that involve the use of music.  Without some nicely articulated objects in place, the code for those extensions would become unwieldy.</p>

<p>This extension involves your completing some classes that have already been designed.  Each class has an API described here and in the class's JavaDoc comments.  A JUnit test case is written both to help you create a correct implementation of the design and to demo your work for credit.</p>

<p>##Before Starting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update your workspace and look for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">chords</code> packages in
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> source folder, which include the following</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">chords.gui</code></p>

<p>This package has objects that are provided for your use.  You do not need to make any changes to these classes.</p>

<p>Later, the class you will most likely use from this package is <code class="highlighter-rouge">TwoDimensionsionalGUI</code>,  which helps applications use the current position of the mouse in the Sedgewick drawing panel as a control mechanism.</p>

<p>For now, run the provided <code class="highlighter-rouge">TwoDimensionalGUIExample</code> and watch the effects of moving your mouse around in the window.  This code uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TwoDimensionalGUI</code>'s <code class="highlighter-rouge">update()</code> method in an event loop, such as the ones you have seen before that accomplish animation.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">chords.testing</code></p>

<p>This package contains the tests for the code you will develop. Most of them are JUnit tests, but one (<code class="highlighter-rouge">PlayTest</code>), is an application that you will run to test your code.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">chords.music</code></p>

<p>This package contains skeleton classes for the code you will develop. Follow the instructions below, in the order given, to simplify your efforts.</p>

<p>##Development Sequence</p>

<p>Some general guidelines follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Pay attention to the <em>user story</em> told about each class.  Recall that each <em>has-a</em> indicates the need for an instance variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Name your variables appropriately, and protect them from access by other classes by declaring them <code class="highlighter-rouge">private</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where appropriate, include <code class="highlighter-rouge">final</code> on the declaration of instance variables, so that their values cannot be changed after the constructor finishes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create meaningful <code class="highlighter-rouge">toString()</code> methods.  Make sure these do not produce <em>too</em> much information.  For example, if a class contains a large array of values, those should not be included in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">toString()</code> result.  Instead, include the size of the array in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">toString()</code> result if it could be useful.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OK, now follow the steps below, <strong>in order</strong>, to develop the classes for this extension:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples</code> class as we will complete this class first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take a look at the first constructor in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples</code>- the one whose signature is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples(double[])</code>.</p>

    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples</code> object <em>has-a</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> array of samples. This constructor takes in such an array, and the constructor must capture the array <strong>by making a copy of its values</strong> to be retained as an instance variable.</p>

    <p>This is a bit unusual:  you would normally capture an instance variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">val</code> by writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">this.val = val</code>, but for an array, that would retain the <em>reference</em> to the array without copying its values. While the reference is sufficient to access the array's values, there is no guarantee that code outside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples</code> class won't change the array after the constructor returns.</p>

    <p>To guard against this, your constructor must make a <em>copy</em> of the array's values.  As a reminder, this involves:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Declaring the instance variable to be an array of <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> values.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the constructor, instantiating the array the be the same size as the parameter array's size.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After instantiating the array, writing a loop to copy the values one-by-one from the parameter into the instance variable copy.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">testConstructor1()</code> test will not pass until you have also completed <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNumSamples()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">getSample(int i)</code>, so once you have completed the constructor, we advise that you complete these two simpler methods before unit testing again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">double getSample(int)</code> method, which should return the value of sample <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>.   Note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">getSample(0)</code> returns the first value, because (like most things in Java), we begin our samples at index <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNumSamples()</code> method by returning the length of the instance-variable array of samples.</p>

    <p>Run the unit tests, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testConstructor1()</code> unit test should pass at this point, as well as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNumSamples()</code> unit test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second constructor for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples</code> has signature <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples(int)</code>. It does not accept an input array, but instead it should instantiate the instance variable to be an array of the specified <code class="highlighter-rouge">length</code>, all zero.  Such an array is not not directly useful or suitable for play-back, but is useful as a base for composing or extending other samples. Java does initialize all newly instantiated <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> arrays to zero automatically.</p>

    <p>This constructor also requires <code class="highlighter-rouge">getNumSamples()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">getSample(int i)</code> to be completed before it will pass <code class="highlighter-rouge">testConstructor2</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">play()</code> method by having Sedgewick's <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdAudio</code> class play the instance-variable array of samples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">toString()</code> method to return a useful string to describe the contained samples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getMax()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">getMin()</code> methods so that they do what their comments say they should do.</p>

    <p>Run the unit tests, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testMax()</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">testMin()</code> unit tests should pass at this point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">concat(Samples)</code> method, which takes <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> sequence of samples and an <code class="highlighter-rouge">other</code> sequence of samples and return a new sequence that is the concatenation of the two. Note that this must return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">new Samples</code> object.  The current object must not be changed!</p>

    <p>Run the unit tests, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testConcat()</code> unit test should pass at this point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">combine(Samples)</code> method, which takes <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> sequence of samples and an <code class="highlighter-rouge">other</code> sequence of samples, and sums them, element-by-element, to form a new sequence of samples. If one sequence is shorter than the other, it is as if the shorter sequence had zeros as the sums are computed.</p>

    <p>Run the unit tests, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testCombine()</code> unit test should pass at this point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OK after all that work, open <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pitch</code> and you will see that this class is done for you.</p>

    <p>Run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PitchTest</code> unit tests, and they should pass at this point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SingleTone</code> class.  A <code class="highlighter-rouge">SingleTone</code> <em>has-a</em> frequency which should be retained as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the constructor for <code class="highlighter-rouge">SingleTone</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">getSamples()</code> by generating samples at the specified <code class="highlighter-rouge">amplitude</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">duration</code>. Recall that a <code class="highlighter-rouge">SingleTone</code> <em>has-a</em> a frequency, so the
frequency used for the samples should be stored as an instance variable in your class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getOverTone(double)</code> method, which returns a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">SingleTone</code> object whose frequency is the specified mutliple of <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> one's frequency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getOverTone(int,int)</code> method, which should return its result by reduction to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">getOverTone(double)</code> method. This means that you should return the result of <code class="highlighter-rouge">getOverTones(int,int)</code> by returning a suitable call of <code class="highlighter-rouge">getOverTone(double)</code>.</p>

    <p>Run the unit tests, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testOvertones()</code> unit test should pass at this point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code>.  This class represents notes that form a major scale, such as the natural (usually, white) keys do on a piano.  A <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code> <em>has-a</em> starting <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pitch</code>, which should be retained as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pitch</code> reference.</p>

    <p>We could have designed this class to retain the starting pitch as an integer, but with the richer object <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pitch</code> we should use it instead.</p>

    <p>Why?</p>

    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pitch</code> object can easily compute other related pitches, and return its representation as a frequency.   We could carry out these computations on any integer, but by having it already programmed in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pitch</code>, we should use that object to avoid code duplication, avoid work, and increase reliability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first constructor is already completed in terms of the second one, so you don't have to worry about the first constructor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second constructor must be completed, but it simply stores its incoming parameter in the instance variable you provisioned above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let's look at <code class="highlighter-rouge">getPitch(int)</code>.  This method returns the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pitch</code> that is the specified diatonic distance from this <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code>'s starting pitch.  What makes this tricky is that the diatonic notes are not evenly spaced.  This can be most easily understood by looking at the chromatic distances between the natural keys on a piano. The following table shows the relative chromatic distances between the notes of a diatonic scale:</p>

    <table border="">
<tr> <th> Example in <br />key of C major</th> <th> Diatonic<br />offset` <th> Chromatic offset<br /> from previous<br /> diatonic note</th> &lt;/TR&gt;
<tr> 
  <td> C </td> 
  <td> 0 </td> 
  <td> N/A </td> 
</tr>
<tr> 
  <td> D </td> 
  <td> 1 </td> 
  <td> 2 </td> 
</tr>
<tr> 
  <td> E </td> 
  <td> 2 </td> 
  <td> 2 </td> 
</tr>
<tr> 
  <td> F </td> 
  <td> 3 </td> 
  <td> 1 </td> 
</tr>
<tr> 
  <td> G </td> 
  <td> 4 </td> 
  <td> 2 </td> 
</tr>
<tr> 
  <td> A </td> 
  <td> 5 </td> 
  <td> 2 </td> 
</tr>
<tr> 
  <td> B </td> 
  <td> 6 </td> 
  <td> 2 </td> 
</tr>
<tr> 
  <td> C </td> 
  <td> 7 </td> 
  <td> 1 </td> 
</tr>
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Moreover, the `getPitch(int)` method must accommodate values for its parameter that are negative, zero, or positive, and those values maybe outside the range of a single octave.

This is the trickiest method:  get help from the TAs or instructor if you need it.


* Run the unit tests for `DiatonicScale` and they should pass at this point.
* You can also run `DiatonicScale` as an applicaiton and it should print out some information about some scales.

  <li>
    <p>Complete the constructor for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triad</code>. The constructor takes in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code> and an <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code>, which is the diatonic offset of the root of the triad.</p>

    <p>The other two pitches are 2 and 4 diatonic offsets away from the root.</p>

							<h2 id=6>Extension 7.6: Chord Organ (4 points)</h2>
							<p>You will use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triad</code> and other classes you have
developed to make a simple chord organ that resembles the following:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/kbd.png" /></p>

<p>The goal of your work is to hear the a diatonic triad play in the C major scale when your mouse enters the correspondingly marked rectangle.</p>

<p>##Procedure</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ChordOrgan</code> class in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">chords</code> package. This is where you will write your code for this extension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arrange for a screen such as the one shown above to be drawn, and detect mouse entry into the specified rectangles. To help you with this, consider the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BoundingBoxGUIExample</code> class in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">chords.gui</code> package:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">BoundingBoxGUIExample</code> as an application and observe what happens when your mouse enters the displayed rectangle.</li>
      <li>Read the comments and the code for <code class="highlighter-rouge">BoundingBoxGUIExample</code>, and get help if anything is unclear.</li>
      <li>Now try to create the GUI shown above.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your code will be shorter and easier to write if you think through how to represent the 8 keys shown in the GUI.  You could use many separate variables, but if you think abstractly, you will use arrays to represent the values of interest.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For the steps of the development described below, however, you <strong>must</strong> use the specified classes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Construct a <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code>  instance in the key of C:</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale ds = new DiatonicScale(3);</code></p>

    <p>This makes a diatonic scale object with high C as its base note.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make a given triad at offset <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code>, use</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Triad t = new Triad(ds,i);</code></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can get samples from that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triad</code> (using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triad</code>'s <code class="highlighter-rouge">getSamples(double,double)</code>) of an amplitude and duration of your choosing and then cause them to be played using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples</code> class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demonstrate your work to a TA using a computer with sound enabled.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

							<h2 id=7>Extension 7.7: 6-1-4-5 - How To Be Famous (8 points)</h2>
							<p>Much has been written about the tendency for musicians from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Pachelbel">Pachelbel</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_%28singer%29">Pink</a> to write songs based on a common chord progression:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_containing_the_I-V-vi-IV_progression"> I-V-vi-IV</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://sixfouronefive.blogspot.com/"> Six Four One Five </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2008/12/31/striking_a_chord/">Striking a Chord</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In response of this, the <a href="http://www.axisofawesome.net/">Axis of Awesome</a> has realized that the only barrier to their becoming famous is their lack of a four-chord song, as documented extensively in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ">this amazing video</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpB_40hYjXU">this other amazing video</a>.</p>

<p>Axis of Awesome needs <strong>your help</strong> to record their soon-to-be-hit four-chord song.</p>

<p>In this extension, you use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">chords.music</code> classes you developed above to create a 4-chord song.  The song consists of two <code class="highlighter-rouge">Samples</code> of music, <em>background</em> and <em>tune</em>, which are <code class="highlighter-rouge">combine</code>d throughout to make a song.  As the song plays, you can control how much of what you hear is background and how much is tune.</p>

<p>##Overview</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SixFourOneFive</code> class in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">chords</code> package. Your work for this extension will be done in this class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">TwoDimensionalGUI</code> class is provided for your use in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">chords.gui</code> package.</p>

    <p>To see how it works</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TwoDimensionalGUIExample</code> and move your mouse in the window to control the size and shading of the displayed circle.</li>
      <li>Read the constructor and the code in the class.</li>
      <li>You can instantiate this class yourself and use it to select the amount of background and tune present in your sound output.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The code you write will resemble the example GUI and all other programs based on an <em>event loop</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each iteration of your infinite event loop prepares four seconds of sound for output.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>These four seconds are one musical measure.</li>
      <li>Each measure has four beats</li>
      <li>Each second of time corresponds to one beat of the four-beat measure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, each measure goes through the four chords of your four-chord song, with one second spent on each chord.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The music you generate consists of background (chords) and a tune:</p>

    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

    <p>The background of your song is a constant progression of Six-Four-One-Five chords.  These chords can be generated using the classes you have above as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you construct a <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code> with starting pitch <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>,  then its scale is C major starting on high C.</li>
      <li>Although the chord pattern is called Six Four One Five, this assumes the root chord is One.  For us, the root chord is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>, so the diatonic offsets for our chords are really <code class="highlighter-rouge">5 3 0 4</code>.</li>
      <li>That <code class="highlighter-rouge">5</code> chord is a bit high and sqeaky, so we lower it by an octave, subtracting 7 diatonic steps to get <code class="highlighter-rouge">-2</code>. The resulting chord sequence in terms of diatonic offsets is</li>
    </ul>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">-2 3 0 4</code></p>

    <ul>
      <li>If we name the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code> of interest <code class="highlighter-rouge">ds</code>, then the  triads of interest are as follows:</li>
    </ul>

    <table>
  <tr> <th>Chord</th> <th> Name in C major</th> <th> Triad </th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Six </td> <td> a minor </td> <td> new Triad(ds, -2) </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Four </td> <td> F major </td> <td> new Triad(ds,  3) </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> One </td> <td> C major </td> <td> new Triad(ds,  0)</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Five </td> <td> G major </td> <td> new Triad(ds,  4)  </td> </tr>
  </table>

    <p>Because <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triad</code>s are constructed relative to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Triad</code> instantiations above create Six Four One Five for whatever key the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale</code> object was constructed.</p>

    <p>The background consists of rotating among the above chords, with each chord playing for one second (a quarter note).</p>

    <p><strong>Tune</strong></p>

    <p>The tune is generated randomly, with each note having random pitch and duration:</p>

    <p><strong>Duration</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Each chord of the background lasts for one second, and you need to generate a one-second tune to be combined and played with the background.</li>
      <li>You could pick a single note for the one second, but that would not be rhythmically interesting.</li>
      <li>Instead, let's begin with a nominal beat that is one second in duration.</li>
      <li>That beat could be subdivided into two beats of half the original duration, so two half-second notes.</li>
      <li>The process of subdividing could continue to obtain smaller rhythmic units such as four quarter-second notes, eight eighth-second notes, etc.</li>
      <li>No matter how much we subdivide the beat, the resulting rhythmic units sum to one second when played continguously.</li>
      <li>If the above process is not somewhat random, the resulting rhythms would still be quite regular and uninteresting.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your challange is to devise a method for randomly breaking a one-second beat into smaller units.  The units should not always be the same.  For example, one way to divide one second might result in the following, played consecutively:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>2 eighth-second notes</li>
      <li>1 eighth-second note</li>
      <li>2 sixteenth-second notes</li>
      <li>1 quarter-second note</li>
      <li>1 quarter-second note</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pitch</strong></p>

    <p>Once one of the above rhythmic units is complete, its pitch should be chosen from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale">diatonic scale</a> in the key of C major. Construct a <code class="highlighter-rouge">DiatonicScale(3)</code> object and use its <code class="highlighter-rouge">getPitch(int)</code> to get a random diatonic pitch from the C-major scale.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
