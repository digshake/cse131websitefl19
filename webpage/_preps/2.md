  * Produce output that corresponds the number of feet and any leftover
       inches when converted from the specified input.
  * Be sure your output:

  * Uses the word **feet** for plural and **foot** for 
singular number of feet.
  * Uses the word **inches** for plural and **inch** for 
singular number of feet.

For example:

  * 13 inches will produce:  1 foot and 1 inch
  * 17 inches will produce:  1 foot and 5 inches
  * 28 inches will produce:  2 feet and 4 inches
