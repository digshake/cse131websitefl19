# Exercise: Anatomy of an Object

* In the `exercises7` package
	of the `exercises` source folder, open
	the `Person` class.

* Follow the instructions, using Java comments to designate the
	various parts of the object\'s definition.

# Exercise: Try designing an object

You have seen examples of object design in the videos.  Now it\'s your turn.

* Think of an object you want to design:  perhaps something important
	or relevant to your life.  It should be some kind of noun, related to your
	studies, hobbies, or other interests.

* In the `exercises7` package
	of the `exercises` source folder, create a new class named
	appropriately for the object you are designing.

* In that file, define the object\'s instance variables, constructor(s),
	and methods.  Provide accessors and mutators where appropriate.
