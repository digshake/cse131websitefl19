#Procedure

Preparation:

Update your repository so that you see a `lab6` package in the `labs` source folder.


1. Consider the old camp song:

	>*n* bottles of beer on the wall, *n* bottles of beer;
	>you take one down, pass it around, *n-1* bottles of beer on the wall.
	>
	>*n-1* bottles of beer on the wall, *n-1* bottles of beer;
	>you take one down, pass it around, *n-2* bottles of beer on the wall.

	and so on down to 0 bottles of beer on the wall.

	* Find the recursive substructure in the above song.

	* Create a new class `Beer` in your `lab6` package.
	  
	> Be sure to check the box that asks for `public static void main` to be generated.
	  
	* In your `Beer` class, develop a recursive algorithm `String bottlesOfBeer(int n)` that computes the song starting at *n* and ending at *0*. Your recursive method should not print anything, but when your algorithm is working, print the string finally returned by the recursive method.

	* Write code into the main method of `Beer` to call `bottlesOfBeer(5)` and print out the string returned by that method.

	* Test your program for other input parameters. Be prepared to demo this for a TA to receive credit for this lab.

2. Here is a simple but interesting recursive function.

        f(x) =    x-10     if x > 100
             = f(f(x+11))  if x <= 100
		
	* Using the substitution model, sketch the computation of `f(99)`.
  
	> Be prepared to show your substitution model computation to a TA when you demo.
  
	* Sketch the computation of `f(87)`.
  
	* Be prepared to answer the following questions about the above code:
	
		* Will this function terminate for all positive integers supplied as arguments.
		
		* What do you expect this function to do for values of x > 100?
		
		* How will it behave for values <= 100?
	
	* In the `Methods` class, implement the function, test it to develop or valdiate your hypotheses, and be prepared to demo your function to a TA.

3. Here is another interesting recursive function:

        g(x,y)  = y+1               if x = 0
                = g(x-1,1)          if x > 0 and y = 0
                = g(x-1, g(x, y-1)) if x > 0 and y > 0

	* Using the substitution model, sketch the computations  of 
		
		* g(1,0)
		
		* g(1,2)
		
		* g(2,2)
  
	* Will this function terminate for all positive integers supplied as arguments?

	* How do you expect this function behave with respect to **x** and **y**?

	* Implement it and try it out for values of x < 4 and various values of y.

	* Now try it for x = 4 and various values of y.

	* What do you see?
  
	> You may be interested to know that the red square button will terminate your application.
  
	* Why does the function behave this way?

4. Consider the picture below.

	* Think about what you see:  what is foreground and what is background?
  
	* Develop an approach for drawing the figure recursively.
  
		* What is the base case?
	 
		* What are the recursive calls doing?
	 
	* Create a `Triangles` class in the `lab6` package.

	* Implement your ideas in the `Triangles` class, and be prepared to demo and discuss your code to a TA to receive credit for this lab.
