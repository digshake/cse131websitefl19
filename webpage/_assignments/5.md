# More Zombies: There's a *METHOD* to their Madness!

This assignment is a follow-up to Lab 4, where you wrote code that could read a data file and display entities being simulated.  Here you'll build on Lab 4 in two ways:

* Now that we have a new technique, methods, you'll take your prior work and adjust it to work well with methods.
* You'll extend it with additional methods and complete the basic zombie simulator.

# New Techniques & Topics

## Refactoring

[Refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring){:target="_blank"} is a technique used to refine computer code.  The basic idea is to restructure code without changing overall behavior.  Often refactoring is done because either:

* code is difficult to manage (too complex) and reorganizing it will make it easier to update/fix/understand or
* new techniques provide better ways of writing the code.  
  
Part of your work here will be easier if you just refactor some of your work from Lab 4.

## Methods

Methods are a fundamental part of computing because:

* They allow us to break complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.  It makes it possible for a single person to write a complex program by working on one small part at a time and ensuring that the small parts can be combined together.
* They allow code to be re-used.  In this case we will do some operations repeatedly and rather than copying/pasting code you can just write a method once (one copy of the code) and call it as-needed.

## Method Return Values

Methods can only return a single "thing", but often we'd like to return multiple things. For example, we'd like to use a method for reading in an entire file for our simulation, however, in Lab 4 we stored that data in three distinct one dimensional arrays.  Here we'll instead use a single two dimensional array of `double`s to contain all of our data.  Like before, each index (row index) will represent a single item.  Rather than using different arrays for the `type`, `x` coordinate, and `y` coordinate, we'll instead use three columns of a two dimensional array. Column 0 will contain the type, column 1 will contain the x coordinate, and column 2 will contain the y coordinate. 

## "Magic" Numbers and Constants

The term [Magic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)) is often used when program code includes numbers that represent special codes.  For example, we're using the number 2 to indicate the column containing a y coordinate.  The number 2 would be considered a "magic number" because it's an arbitrary choice and may not be clear to someone who reads your code. 

In order to make our code more readable we'll use special variables for the indices rather than the "Magic Numbers".  The lab file already contains the three lines:

~~~java
static final int TYPE = 0;
static final int X = 1;
static final int Y = 2;
~~~

These three lines declare variables that represent the column that will contain the type, the column that will contain the x coordinate, and the column that will contain the y coordinate.  *Anytime* a location in the 2D array is used one of these concepts the variables should be used to make your code easier to read.  For example, when someone reads:

~~~java
double a = entities[i][1];
int b = (int)entities[i][0];
~~~

it isn't very clear that the `0` is the type and the `1` the X coordinate (they are magic numbers).   The following is easier to read and less prone to errors:

~~~java
double a = entities[i][X];       // Note the column is indexed with "X". It's clear this should be the X coordinate.
int b = (int)entities[i][TYPE];  // and this column is indexed with "TYPE"
~~~

Of course, using better variable names make it even more readable:

~~~java
double x = entities[i][X];
int type = (int)entities[i][TYPE];
~~~

The lab assignment also includes:

~~~java
static final int ZOMBIE = 1;
static final int NONZOMBIE = 2;
~~~

The words `ZOMBIE` and `NONZOMBIE` should always be used in code rather than the numbers `1` and `2` because things like: `if(entities[i][TYPE] == ZOMBIE)` are a lot easier to read/write (less prone to errors) than: `if(entities[i][0]==1)`.

Whenever you use the concept of `ZOMBIE`, `NONZOMBIE`, `X`, `Y`, and `TYPE` use the variables, *not* the corresponding number.

## Double Buffering

You may have noticed in the Lab 4 that it's possible to see each individual entity being drawn.  This is because drawing on the screen takes a little bit of time. If we're able to see each entity being drawn the simulation will seem slow and jerky.

[Double Buffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering){:target="_blank"} is a technique used to make animations look smooth.  The basic idea is to have two different "frames" (the two buffers).  At any given time one is being shown on the screen and any new drawing takes place on the other one, which isn't being shown.  These two frames are switched and, from the point of view of anyone looking at the screen, a lot of changes take place instantaneously. A sequence of these changes can show an animation in the same way a [flip book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_book){:target="_blank"} works ([Sample Video on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flip_Book_-_Messi_Example.webm){:target="_blank"}).  Much like a flip book, all visible items are drawn in each frame, but the positions of items that are moving change a tiny bit from one frame to another.

`StdDraw` supports double buffering by the following approach:

1. When the program first starts (in `main`) call [`StdDraw.enableDoubleBuffering()`](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html#enableDoubleBuffering--){:target="_blank"}
2. Whenever it is time to change frames:

~~~java
StdDraw.clear();  // Clear the non-shown frame
// Draw *all* objects in their locations (which may have changed from the last frame)
StdDraw.show();  // Swap the non-shown frame with the one being shown on screen.
~~~

## Unit Testing

The final new topic for this lab is a review of [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing){:target="_blank"}.  As you complete each part of this lab you will test that part.  If all the parts work in the intended way there's a much greater chance that they will work when combined together.  

**Special Note: Unit tests help developers make sure the code works, but they usually only test a relatively small number of possible conditions. NEVER assume that code that pasts unit tests "must work".  The test only ensure that it did what those tests expected.  The tests themselves could be flawed and they don't test everything!**

If you fail any unit test cases you should try to read through the test case and see what it's testing.  In this lab all tests cases are either looking for a particular value (via `assertEquals()`) or for a condition to be true (`assertTrue()`).  Doubling clicking on failed tests will take you to the code for that test. Most test cases use concepts that you've encountered previously in the class. With a little review you can probably figure out what the test case is expecting and then try to identify why your code didn't pass it.  The comments in and above the test cases may also provide some guidance.

# Procedure & Recommended Workflow

Below is a recommended work-flow.  Many of the parts are independent and if you get stuck on one you can leave it incomplete and move on to the next, but you may need to ensure there aren't any errors in your code (no red lines). 

1. Open the `ZombieSimulation` in the `src` folder.  Some items have already been done for you.  Most of the remaining work is labeled in the file with `TODO` or `FIXME` comments.  
2. Complete the code for the `readEntities()` method.  You can base it on your work from Lab 4, however:
   1. Be sure that it uses a 2D array rather than parallel arrays.  
   2. Use the `TYPE`, `X`, and `Y` variables when you want to refer to columns for the entity type, the x coordinate, and the y coordinate respectively.
   3. Be sure to `return` the array.  (This is the "result" that will be communicated back to other methods)
3. Open `readEntitiesTest.java` and run it.  You can run all the tests in the file by clicking the "play" button next to the class declaration:<br/>![Run All Tests](../../../assignments/RunAllTests.png) <br/>
4. Examine the results of the test cases.  If they all passed you'll see the following in IntelliJ: <br/>![Read Tests](../../../assignments/ReadTestsPassed.png) <br/>
   * If a test failed it will be displayed in yellow with an X rather than a green check mark.  If you double click on a failed test you'll be taken to the code for that test.  Review the code and the comments above/in the test case test case to try to identify what it's testing and the specific answer that it's looking for.  Then try to update your code to fix the problem.
   * Update your `readEntities()` method until it passes all tests.<br/><br/>
5. Return to `ZombieSimulator.java` and complete `drawEntities()`.  Notice that part of it has already been done for you. Again, you can merge in code from Lab 4.  Review the comment before `drawEntities()` and make sure your code works as described. (The comment is in a special format called JavaDoc)
6. Open `drawEntitiesTests.java` and run the unit tests.  
   * These tests draw things on the screen and require human intervention to confirm that they are drawn properly.  You'll have to type `true` or `false` to indicate if the tests pass.  
   * Update your `drawEntities()` method until it passes all tests.<br/><br/>
7. Return to `ZombieSimulator.java` and compete the code for the `touchingZombie()` method.  Again, notice that the comments above it give a brief description what it should do.
   * Hint: Consider entities to be touching if they overlap. Use the distance formula.
8. Open `touchingZombieTests.java` and run all the tests.
   * Update your `touchingZombie()` method until it passes all tests.<br/><br/>
9.  Return to `ZombieSimulator.java` and complete the code in `updateEntities()`. Follow the directions given in the comment.
    * Each entity should move randomly.  We'll keep it simple by using [Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion){:target="_blank"}. Change the x coordinate by a random value between -0.005 and +0.005.  Also change the y coordinate by a random value between -0.005 and +0.005.
    * No entities should be able to leave the unit square.  All coordinates should be `>=0` and `<=1.0` at all times.  Consider this when updating the location of an entity.
    * If a non-zombie touches a zombie it will become a zombie (its type will change.)
10. Open `updateEntitiesTests.java` and run the tests.
    * Update your `updateEntities()` method until it passes all tests.  <br/><br/>
11. Return to `ZombieSimulator.java`.  You'll need to complete a `nonzombieCount()` method. Search the file for `nonzombieCount`.  The file already contains the comment block, but the method itself is commented out because it is incomplete.  Remove the comments and replace the two `TYPE` words with appropriate types for the return value and parameter type.  
    * Hint: You can uncomment or comment multiple lines by highlighting them and then typing `Control-/` (on a PC) or `Command-/` on a Mac.
12. Complete the code for `nonzombieCount()`
13. Open `nonzombieCountTests.java`
    * All the tests were commented out until `nonzombieCount()` was completed.  Remove the comments and run the tests. (Hint: You can uncomment or comment multiple lines by highlighting them and they typing `Control-/` (on a PC) or `Command-/` on a Mac.)
    * Update your `nonzombieCount()` method until it passes all tests.<br/><br/>

14. Almost done!  You just need to complete the actual simulation. Open `ZombieSimulator.java` and complete the `TODO` in the `main()` method. HINT: this should be short.  It can be done in ~4-6 lines of code.
15. Run `ZombieSimulator.java`.  Try a few of the files that are provided (`zombieWorld.sim`, `surrounded.sim`, `inTheHouse.sim`, `bubbles.sim`, etc.)
16. *Review your work!*  Make sure you understand what each method does.  Review how the individual methods fit into the overall process of simulating the zombie world.
17. Search the file for any `TODO` or `FIXME` comments.  If the items are completed, remove the comment (otherwise complete them)
18. Feel free to add in more features:
    1. Count how many "turns" (updates) are completed before all the nonzombies have turned into zombies.
    2. Compute and print the percentage of nonzombies remaining at each update of the simulation
    3. Etc.

# Assignment Requirements

Partial credit is possible and will be based on the number of unit tests that are passed, but for full credit:

* Each method should pass all tests cases
* The `ZombieSimulator` should run.  
  * It should repeatedly update entities until only zombies remain (at which point it should stop updating)
  * It should show the results after each update

Here's an example run:
