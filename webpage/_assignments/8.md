# Zombies: The Final OBJECTive 

In Lab 4 we used the notion of "parallel arrays" to store details of the entities that we wanted to simulate.  In Lab 5 we created an actual simulation, but in order to make it manageable we refactored the work from Lab 4 using Methods.  Since Methods can only return a single value, we used a two dimensional array to represent all of our entities.  This approach only worked because every aspect of our entity could easily be represented by a number: either a coordinate or a numeric code  that represented it's type (1 for zombie vs. 2 for non-zombie).  Now that we've seen the concept of an actual Abstract Data Type (ADT), it makes more sense to use different data types to represent a zombie vs. a non-zombie.  We'll literally have variables of type `Zombie` and `Nonzombie`.  

We've consistently referred to both zombies and non-zombies as Entities because they have several things in common.  Each has a location and certain common things they can do (like be drawn and be moved).  Consequently, it makes sense to have a Java interface type called `Entity` that describes these common features.  

Both our `Zombie` and `Nonzombie` types will `implement` the `Entity` interface.  We could say that a `Zombie` is-an `Entity` and a `Nonzombie` also is-an `Entity`.  This will allow us to have a collection of `Entity` objects, like an array (an `Entity[]`) or some type of `List` (like `LinkedList<Entity>`) that can contain any specific type of `Entity` --- both `Zombie`s and `Nonzombie`s.  

In this installment of the zombie saga we will:
- Refactor our code to use an `Entity interface` with `Zombie` and `Nonzombie` classes. 
- Use a collection of `Entity` objects (a type of [`List`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html){:target="_blank"} rather than an array)
- Rather than having all entities move randomly, we'll make our `Zombie`s and `Nonzombie`s behave somewhat intelligently
- When a `Nonzombie` is touching a `Zombie` there's a chance it will be consumed (one fewer entity) rather than always turn into a `Zombie`

# Files

Your project includes a number of source files:
- `Entity.java`: The `Entity` interface.  Review this file, which defines all the methods that any valid `Entity` needs to support. ***You should not modify this file in any way***
- `Zombie.java`: The ADT for zombies. ***You will need to complete this file***
- `Nonzombie.java`: The ADT for nonzombies. ***You will need to complete this file***
- `EntityUtilities.java`: This file is mostly done for you, but contains two `TODO` items. ***You will need to complete this file***
- `tests/drawEntitiesTests.java`: Unit tests for drawing entities.
- `teests/readEntitiesTests.java`: Unit tests for reading in Entities from files.
- `tests/testUtilities.java`: Unit tests for utility methods.
  
# Procedure & Recommended Workflow

Below is a recommended work-flow.  You should follow the first few six steps to ensure your work can compile and be tested.  After that you can jump around a little if desired.

1. Open `Entity.java` and review the methods that any `Entity` will need to be able to perform.  Don't modify this file. <br /><br />
2. Open `Zombie.java`.  Note that it's nearly empty and `public class Zombie implements Entity` is underlined in red.  The error is because it indicates it `implements Entity`, but it  doesn't currently support any of the `Entity` methods.  If you hover over the error you'll be given a small help window with the option to `Implement methods`.  Select it and then use the default choice on the next window.  This will insert incomplete versions of all the missing methods. <br /><br />
3. Some of the unit tests provided assume that a `Zombie` will have a constructor that is provided with just a location.  Create a `public` constructor with `(double x, double y)` parameters for Zombie. The radius should default to 0.005. (You can complete the actual implementation of as much of `Zombie` as you'd like now, but some details may have to wait).<br /><br />
4. Repeat the two previous steps for `Nonzombie.java`: 
   1. Create incomplete implementations for all the `Entity` methods.
   2. Create a constructor that will be passed an `x` and `y` coordinate. Again, the radius should default to 0.005.<br /><br />
5. The unit tests assume that the junit package is included.  
   1. Open `testUtilities.java` 
   2. Go to the `import` section at the top of the file and expand the imports (click the plus on the left of the `import` that's shown)
   3. Hover over `junit`, which is highlighted in red (it should look somewhat like [this](https://piazza.com/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=attach%2Fjyq2cxzvfwc3io%2Fis7toymzkj819c%2Fjzuffkh9ckki%2FExercise6AddTest.png){:target="_blank"} example from the exercises)
   4. Select the `Add JUnit4 to classpath` option.<br /><br />
6. At this point you should be able to run the unit test files, but many tests may fail.<br /><br />
7. Review `EntityUtilities.java`
   1. Notice that there are several methods provided for you that may be helpful (like `findClosestZombie()`, `moveTowards()`, etc.).  Methods in this file are intended to work with any valid `Entity`.
   2. Complete the two `TODO` items.  Notice that these both work with variables that are-an `Entity`.
   3. Run the unit tests in `testUtilities.java` and fix any errors in your work in `EntityUtilities`<br /><br />
8. Both `Zombie`s and `Nonzombie`s will need to be able to draw themselves. Complete the `draw()` method in each class.  `Zombie`s should be drawn with red dots and `Nonzombie`s should be drawn with black dots.  Note that `Entity`s have getters and setters for their radius, x, and y values.  You should implement support for all of these.
   1. Run the unit tests in `drawEntitiesTests.java` and fix any errors in your work.<br /><br />
9.  Open `ZombieSimulator.java` and carefully read through the file.  Complete the `TODO` items. 
    1.  First finish `readEntities()`
    2.  Run the unit tests in `readEntitiesTests.java` and fix any errors in your work.
    3. Complete any remaining `TODO` items.
    4. `updateEntities()` will call the `updateEntity()` method in each specific entity. `updateEntity()` will be passed a list of all current entities (this allows an entity to try to make a rational decision based on all other entities, like running away from a zombie). The `updateEntity()` method will `return` the `Entity` to be used in the next round of the simulation.  For example,
      - A `Nonzombie` may  return a `Zombie` when it is updated. This would replace the `Nonzombie` with the corresponding `Zombie` in the next round of simulation.
      - Any `Entity` could return `null`, which would indicate that the entity wouldn't be included any more (that it died or escaped).<br /><br />
10. After completing all the `TODO` items in `ZombieSimulator.java` and passing all the unit test you should have a runnable simulation, but your entities won't be doing anything interesting.  You still need to complete the `updateEntity()` method in both `Zombie` and `Nonzombie`.  Start with the random motion that you used in Lab 5.<br /><br />
11. Now that we have a working simulation it's time to make it more realistic.  You should develope different, but rational strategies to update both `Zombie` and `Nonzombie`.  Here are some requirements:
    - When a  `Nonzombie` touches a `Zombie` it should there is a random chance that it will be consumed by the `Zombie`
      - 80% of the time the `Nonzombie` is replace by  a `Zombie` at the same location and with the same size. 
      - 20% of the time it is consumed by the `Zombie` that is touching it (the closest if many are).  The `Zombie` that consumes it will increase in radius by 20% of the `Nonzombie`'s radius up to a maximum of 0.20.
    - `Zombie`s are hungry.  There should be circumstances where they intentionally (not randomly) move toward `Nonzombie`s. 
    - `Nonzombie`s don't want to be infected.  There should be circumstances where they move in a way that reduces their chance of becoming a `Zombie`.  They could move such that they try to avoid populated areas, or avoid `Zombie`s, or they could believe there's safety in numbers and try to approach other `Nonzombie`s. 
    - `Entity` movement should be fluid.  They should never appear at unusual locations. (Moving an `Entity` by less than 1 radius usually achieves this effect)
	- You're welcome to do more elaborate approaches or minor variations on the above to see how they impact the simulation (try to have fun running experiments).

# Assignment Requirements

Partial credit is possible and will be based on the number of unit tests that are passed and the degree to which you complete the required update strategies. For full credit:

* All unit tests should pass
* The `ZombieSimulator` should run.  
  * It should repeatedly update entities
  * Your `Zombie`s should move, try to consume `Nonzombie`s, and occasionally increase in size after consuming a `Nonzombie` up to a maximum size (designated above)
  * `Nonzombie`s should be consumed by `Zombie`s after about 20% of run-ins and turn into `Zombie`s the other 80% of the time.
  * Your `Nonzombie`s should move and have some reasonable approach to survival (not just random motion all the time)
  * Animation should be reasonably smooth (nothing should jump to new locations on the screen)

Here's an example run of one approach.  Here `Nonzombie`s flee from other `Nonzombie`s (they think they will be safe in isolated areas).  `Zombie`s can "smell" `Nonzombie`s and relentlessly pursue the closest one:<br/>
