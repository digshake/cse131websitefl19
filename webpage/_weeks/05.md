Methods (functions) allow us to specify computations that will likely be performed over and over again, with certain input values changed. By the end of this module, you should be able to write `static` Java methods that compute and return values of interest. You should develop some intuition about the proper definition and use of methods, which variables should be input paramters for those methods, and which values should be returned from method calls.
