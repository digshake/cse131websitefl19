This is a continuation of the previous extension.  It is therefore
suggested that you
do the previous extension first.

## Directions:

The main program you should run for this extension is **Background**, which
conveniently
sets up the images in the bar and panels for you to do this work.

So run **Background** as a Java application.  You will see two
similar images in the source panels, and some other images in the image
bar.

Open the **Filters** class and begin your work as described
below.  

### Two more **Color** filters

> You can use **if** statements for this work.

1. Complete the method *bgSubtract* so that it returns a **Color** as follows:

	* If the **source1Color** and **source2Color** colors are
	*sufficiently similar*, return **Color.BLUE**. The idea is to subtract
	the background so that what is common between the two source images is shown
	in blue.

		We will define a new term for this lab, the *Saturation Tolerance*. What this tells us is how different two colors can be, and still be considered 
		*sufficiently similar*. For instance; if the *Saturation Tolerance* is 10, one color has a red value of 130, and another color has a 
		red value of 138, these would be considered *sufficiently similar*. But if one color had a red value of 35 and another had a red value of 50, they would not 
		be considered *sufficiently similar*

	* Otherwise, return **source1Color**.

	An example is shown below:

	![](../../../extensions/bg1.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
	
	Where the two images are similar, the corresponding pixel in the
	target image is blue, because your method returned **Color.BLUE**.
	Where the images differ, the first image is shown in the target,
	because your method returned the pixel color from the first image.

2. Complete the method *bgReplace* that functions as
follows:

	* If the **source1Color** is **Color.BLUE**, then return
	the **source2Color**.
	* Otherwise, return **source1Color**.

	The effect of this filter is to replace the blue color from the first image
	with the corresponding pixels from the second image.

	To see this work, perform the following steps:

	1. Drag the blue-screen image from the target panel and drop it into the leftmost source panel.  The GUI should replace what was there with the blue-screen
	image. 
	
	2. Drag the other two-bear picture (the reverse of the one shown in the
	source panel) from the top icon bar into the middle source panel.

		After dragging these images around the GUI, the results should resemble the
		following:

		> **Note:**  No transformation is applied yet.  The *copy* operation appears
		> as the menu choice but the *Go* button was not pressed.

		![](../../../extensions/bg2.png)
		{: style="text-align: center"}
	
	3. Now apply the *bgReplace* filter, and the results resemble the
	following:

		![](../../../extensions/bg3.png)
		{: style="text-align: center"}

	4. For fun, drag the chicken image from the top icon bar into the middle source panel, and reapply the * bgReplace* filter.  The results should
	resemble the following:

		![](../../../extensions/bg4.png)
		{: style="text-align: center"}
	
		The chicken is a smaller image, so it did not take up the entire size of
		the bear image.
