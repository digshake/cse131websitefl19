: The idea for this assignment comes from the article "Persian Recursion" by Anne M. Burns that appeared on pages 196-199 of *Mathematics Magazine*, volume 7, in 1997


* A video demonstrating my solution can be found [here](../../../extensions/persian.mp4).

* That video instructs you how to speed up the drawing substantially.

* Don\'t speed things up until you see the rug is drawing properly.

In the `extensions` folder open the `recursivepatterns` package and
the `PersianRug` class.
Your task is to complete the method `persianRug` so that it draws a rug similar to the
one shown below:

![](../../../extensions/rug.png)

Each call to `persianRug` works on a given square of the rug.   Consider the picture shown below:

![](../../../extensions/orig.png)


* The square is described by its lower-left corner (in this case, (0,0)), and its size (in this case, 1).

* Each step of the recursion considers the colors of the provided square\'s sides (in this case, blue), and computes
	a color for the two lines to be drawn inside the square (in this case, red).  

	Computing the color of these two lines is what makes the rug look as it does.  More detail is given below
	concerning how to pick a color.

* Further recursion would act on the sub-squares you see in the above picture.  For example, the upper-left
	subsquare has its lower-left corner at (0, 0.5), has size 0.5, and has colors blue, red, red, blue, starting from
	north and proceeding clockwise.

The parameters for `persianRug` are documented in the source code provided to you for this extension.

Notes:

* Colors in this lab are represented as an index into a `Color` array called `palette`.  This
	array is provided for you in the source code and it is passed into your
	`persianRug` method.
	
* Indexes into `palette` are passed into `persianRug` to describe the colors of the
square\'s bordering edges.  For example, blue is represented by index 0 into the `palette` array,
and cyan appears at index 1.

* Picking a color for the two lines drawn inside a given square is the *creative* aspect of this
assignment.  The following should be read carefully and understood before you jump into coding.

	* Although you will eventually pick more diverse colors, we recommend that unti your lab is working,
	you should always use color index 0 for the color of the two drawn lines.

	* Once that is working, you must pick a color that is a function of the square\'s bordering colors (which
	are conveniently represented as indexes into `palette`.   That function must have the following
	properties to perform correctly:

* The function must return a value that is an appropriate index into the `palette` array.

	As you know, 0 is the smallest index, and the largest index is `palette.length-1`.

* The function must return the same value for any permutation of a given square\'s bordering colors.
	For example, if the colors are specified in order red, blue, blue, red, then any square with two blue and two 
	red sides must compute the same color for the two drawn lines.

	Recall that these colors are represented as integers, each being an index into the `palette` array.
	What kinds of functions on integers return the same result no matter the order of those integers?


* Different functions will produce different rugs.  The rug below is computed using the same code as the rug shown at the top of this assignment, but the function was tweaked slightly:

	![](../../../extensions/otherrug.png)
	Perhaps you can see that in the above rug, once a square has red on each of its borders, the two drawn lines inside that square are also red.
	That effect just happens to be a property of the function I used to produce
	the above image.
