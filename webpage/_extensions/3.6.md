##Introduction

In this assignment, we create the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack"> blackjack</a>, the most widely played casino banking game in the world. In blackjack, each player plays against the dealer, not the other players. The goal of blackjack  is to beat the dealer by attaining a score (the sum of the values of your cards) higher than the dealer\'s score without exceeding 21.  Also, many casinos use an 8 deck shoe (meaning eight 52 card decks shuffled together). This practice prevents players from  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_counting">counting cards</a>. 

##Background

* For this implementation, there is a dealer, one human player, and `p` autonomous players. 

* Everyone is initially dealt a two card hand

	* All players\' cards are visible to all players and the dealer. The dealer, however, has only his or her second-dealt card showing at this point.

	* The *value* of a hand is the sum of that hand\'s cards\' values.  A card\'s value is determined as follows:
		
		* If the card\'s rank is between 2 and 9, then the card\'s value is its rank. Thus, the 4 of Diamonds is worth 4 points.

		* A face card is worth 10 points.  Thus, the King of Spades is worth 10 points.

		* An ace is worth 11 points.  Thus, the Ace of Hearts is worth 11 points.

* After the initial deal is complete, the dealer turns to the first player (which will be you, the human), and asks if you want to *hit* or *stand*.
<br>

hit
: means that you take one more card.  The value of that card is then added to the value of your hand. If you still have 21 points or fewer, the dealer will continue to ask if you want to hit.   The dealer will not move on to another player until you *stand* or have *busted*. If by hitting you have exceeded 21 points, you have *busted* and you have lost your bet to the dealer. The dealer moves on to the next player.
<br>

stand  
: means that you do not want any more cards.  Your play in this round is complete.   The dealer moves on to the next player.

* The dealer then moves to the next player using the above protocol.

* When the last player has finished interacting with the dealer, the
dealer then performs the following steps:

	* The dealer\'s hidden card is revealed.  

	* The dealer continues to hit until the dealer\'s hand\'s value is 17 or higher, or the dealer has busted.

* If the dealer busted, then all players who did not previously bust win against the dealer.

* If the dealer did not bust, then all players whose hands have value in excess of the dealer\'s hand\'s value win against the dealer.

* All players whose hands have value less than the dealer\'s hand\'s value lose to the dealer.

* A player whose hand\'s value equals the dealer\'s hand\'s value has <EM>pushed</em>, and has neither won nor lost money.

##Procedure

1. Prompt the user for how many autonomous players, `p`, to have at the table, and how many games to play.

2. Create a new array to keep track of everyone\'s scores, including yourself and the dealer.

3. Construct a loop that will simulate the number of games to be played. Hint: We will have to reset each player\'s score  between games. 

4. Next, create a mechanism that simulates the initial deal of two cards to each player. We must simulate drawing a random card.  Because the suit of the card is not important for this game, we can think of the  deck as only 13 possible cards with equal likelihood of being drawn. Use randomness to draw a card and then calculate its value.

	Remember that cards 2-9 will count as their number, 10-King all count as 10, and Aces count as 11. 

5. Verify that the array stores each player\'s score correctly. A player\'s score must be the sum of both cards drawn.

6. Now we\'ve reached the decision moment in blackjack. Each player decides whether to *hit* or *stand*.  Start with the human player.

	Prompt the human player for their move. In order to make this decision, the human player should be able to see their score and the dealer\'s face-up card. In addition, after each hit, the human player should see their updated score.

7. Once the human player is finished (either by stand, bust, or blackjack), simulate the autonomous players and then the dealer. 

	The dealer follows the casino rule to hit until his score equals 17 or higher and then stand. Let\'s assume that  the autonomous players follow the same rule. You can copy and paste the same game mechanics you used earlier to draw cards.

8. After the dealer finishes his turn, print out the results of that game. Reminder: if a player busts, then they lose. If the dealer  busts, all the players that did not bust win. If neither busts, players with a higher score than the dealer win and players with  a lower score lose. If a player\'s score equals the dealer\'s (non-bust), then it is a tie, called a push. 

	* What was the final score of each player and the dealer?

	* Which players won?

	* Which players busted?

	* Did any players get a blackjack?

	* Did any players push?

9. After all the games have ended, print out the percentage of the games that the human won.

10. Here is a sample solution. In this implementation, player 0 is the dealer, player 1 is the human player,  and players 2 and 3 are autonomous players. Notice that the human player got three blackjacks out of four games!  This is very rare. 


<PRE>
You chose to play 4 games
There are 2 autonomous players playing.

Game 1
The dealer's face-up card has the value of 10
The players' scores are: 
21 18 12 
The Dealer's face-up card has the value of 10. And your current count is 21
You chose to stand!

Player 0 got 20
Player 1 got Blackjack! (21)
 Player 1 beats the dealer!
Player 2 got 18
Player 3 got 20
 Player 3 pushed with 20

Game 2
The dealer's face-up card has the value of 8
The players' scores are: 
15 17 16 
The Dealer's face-up card has the value of 8. And your current count is 15
You hit!

Player 0 got 19
Player 1 Busts! 26
Player 2 got 17
Player 3 Busts! 23

Game 3
The dealer's face-up card has the value of 9
The players' scores are: 
15 14 15 
The Dealer's face-up card has the value of 9. And your current count is 15
You hit!
The Dealer's face-up card has the value of 9. And your current count is 21
Would you like to hit?
You chose to stand!

Player 0 got 17
Player 1 got Blackjack! (21)
 Player 1 beats the dealer!
Player 2 Busts! 24
Player 3 Busts! 22

Game 4
The dealer's face-up card has the value of 11
The players' scores are: 
14 19 7 
The Dealer's face-up card has the value of 11. And your current count is 14
You hit!
The Dealer's face-up card has the value of 11. And your current count is 21
Would you like to hit?
You chose to stand!

Player 0 got Blackjack! (21)
Player 1 got Blackjack! (21)
 Player 1 pushed with 21
Player 2 got 19
Player 3 got 17

The fraction of human wins was 0.5

Optional tasks:

1. Create a different prescribed formula for the autonomous players, perhaps involving an element of randomness.

2. Create a betting system (perhaps similar to gambler\'s ruin) where you can win or lose money each game. Getting a blackjack wins you 150% of your bet! 

3. Alter the game mechanics so that aces can be counted as 1 or 11. 

4. Implement another human decision such as split or double down.

5. Instead of copy and pasting the game dynamics, create a method for the game mechanics. (This task would satisfy extension 5.1 Methodize It)
