## The Problem

Imagine you want to choose the best apartment out of <i>n</i> apartments each with a rating from 0 to 1. The apartment hunting is done in a random order. When you are surveying an apartment, you can evaluate that apartment based on the ones you have seen so far, but you are oblivious to the quality of apartments you have not seen. If the decision to sign a lease for an apartment can be made at the end, this could be solved by simply tracking the maximum rating (and which apartment complex achieved it) and selecting the overall maximum. The difficulty is that the decision must be made immediately due to the high demand of apartments in the market. Once you reject an apartment choice it can not be renounced because it is likely that someone else bought it. The question is finding an optimal strategy that maximizes the probability of the best apartment being chosen.

Such a strategy is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_time" target="_blank"> stopping rule</a>. For example, consider the first <i>k</i> of <i>n</i> apartments, retaining the highest rating, but rejecting all. Continue from <i>k+1</i> to <i>n</i> and select the first apartment who has a rating equal to or greater than the one computed for the first <i>k</i>, choosing the last apartment if it comes to it.

In this extension, your job is to experiment and find the value of <i>k</i> that chooses the best apartment the most times.

## Procedure
We will be utilizing a <kbd>JUnit</kbd> test to verify the results of your experiment. For the unit testing to work, follow the procedure below carefully.

<ol><li>Find the <kbd>Apartment</kbd> class in the <kbd>apartment</kbd> package of your repository.</li>
<li>Complete the code for <kbd>findBestValueAfterStopAtK</kbd>:
<ul><li>This method takes in an array of random doubles along with <kbd>k</kbd>-the stopping point. Your method should:
<ul><li>Iterate over the first <kbd>k</kbd> values of the given array preserving the max then record the NEXT highest number from the <kbd>k</kbd><i>+1</i> to end of the array.</li>
<li>Return the maximum value after using the stopping rule</li></ul></li>
<li>At this point, the <kbd>test1findBestValueAfterStopAtK</kbd> and <kbd>test2lastValueCase</kbd> JUnit tests should pass</li></ul>
<li>Complete the code for <kbd>findOptimalStoppingPoint</kbd>:
<ul><li>This method takes in the number of apartments being considered and the number of experimentation trials for a certain stopping point</li>
<ul><li>Create an array of random doubles corresponding to the number of apartment choices available each ranging from 0 to 1 (utilize <kbd>Math.random</kbd>).</li>
<li>Implement the stopping rule:
<ul><li>Iterate over the first <i>k</i> values of the array preserving the max then record the next highest number from the <i>k+1</i> to <i>N</i> portion.</li></ul><ul><li>Record the maximum of the entire array.</li><ul><li>The best secretary is picked when the max calculated using the stopping rule equals the overall max</ul></li></ul>
<li>To experiment effectively, a loop should run <kbd>trials</kbd> number of times for each value of <i>k</i> to see how many times the best apartment was picked.</li>
<li>The method should return the optimal point-the <i>k</i> where the best apartment was picked the most times</li>

<ul><li>At this time, all three JUnit tests should pass</li></ul>
