For this extension, you will be working with automatic code generation, which will save you time and energy if you want to save any of the cell mappings you create in Conway. In order to get credit for this extension, you  must implement the functionality of `logAndCapture()` in `Conway` to capture the current living cells you have on the board and generate the appropriate Java code for creating those cells in the console. 

For example, the `Four Blinkers` code is captured already, but if you were to generate code for it using `logAndCapture()` the result would look something like this:


<pre>
		Beginning of Log and Capture
		setLiveness(true, 1, 1);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 2);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 3);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 5);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 6);
		setLiveness(true, 1, 7);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 1);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 2);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 3);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 5);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 6);
		setLiveness(true, 5, 7);
		End of Log and Capture
</pre>

The idea is that the code can be copied from the console, pasted into your `Conway` class, and when you choose the right menu item from the interface, the board will be initialized to replicate what you captured.

Once you have `logAndCapture()` working, use this new tool to automatically generate your own Conway patterns in `myDesignOne()`, `myDesignTwo()`, and `myDesignThree()`. For credit for this extension, these patterns should be both intriguing and potentially time-consuming to generate by hand.
