You will use the `Triad` and other classes you have
developed to make a simple chord organ that resembles the following:

The goal of your work is to hear the a diatonic triad play in the C major scale when your mouse enters the correspondingly marked rectangle.

##Procedure

1. Open the `ChordOrgan` class in the `chords` package. This is where you will write your code for this extension.
 
2. Arrange for a screen such as the one shown above to be drawn, and detect mouse entry into the specified rectangles. To help you with this, consider the `BoundingBoxGUIExample` class in the `chords.gui` package:

	* Run `BoundingBoxGUIExample` as an application and observe what happens when your mouse enters the displayed rectangle.
	* Read the comments and the code for `BoundingBoxGUIExample`, and get help if anything is unclear.
	* Now try to create the GUI shown above.

	Your code will be shorter and easier to write if you think through how to represent the 8 keys shown in the GUI.  You could use many separate variables, but if you think abstractly, you will use arrays to represent the values of interest.

For the steps of the development described below, however, you **must** use the specified classes.

1. Construct a `DiatonicScale`  instance in the key of C:

	`DiatonicScale ds = new DiatonicScale(3);`

	This makes a diatonic scale object with high C as its base note.

2. To make a given triad at offset `i`, use

`Triad t = new Triad(ds,i);`

3. You can get samples from that `Triad` (using `Triad`\'s `getSamples(double,double)`) of an amplitude and duration of your choosing and then cause them to be played using the `Samples` class.

4. Demonstrate your work to a TA using a computer with sound enabled.
