## Manipulating an Image Raster

In the **imagetransforms** package, modify the provided **Transforms** Java program
to implement the methods as described below.
Your methods will use iteration (either **while** loops or **for** loops) to operate on the pixels of a picture.

### Notes

* To run this extension, right (control) click on **Main** and choose **Run as...** then **Java Application**.  

	This extension uses
	the same base code as the filter extension.
*  The **Picture** class is a Sedgewick class whose API is documented on page 720 of our text.
The coordinates are expressed using the standard in computer science graphics: 
the coordinate *(x,y)* denotes
the pixel that is 

	* *x* pixels to the right of the leftmost edge of the picture
	* *y* pixels down from the top edge of the picture

	Thus, *(0,0)* is the top left corner of the picture.
* Pixel addressing follows the common Java convention:  if there are *w* horizontal pixels, then 0 is
the first (leftmost) and *w-1* is the last (rightmost).

* Almost all of the methods are written in terms of two **Picture** parameters:

	* **source**:  the picture to be used as input to your transformation
	* **target**:  the picture area to be used as output from your transformation


	> There is just one exception:  the **gradient** method produces its output
	> without needing a source.  Its only parameter is
	> **target**.


* Each **Picture** has a width and a height, and these can be obtained
for a **Picture p** as follows:

	```
	int width  = p.width();
	int height = p.height();
	```
* To find the **Color** of a pixel at location **x,y**, you use

	`Color c = source.get(x,y);`

* To set the **Color** of a pixel at location **x,y** to the color **c**, you use

	`target.set(x,y,c);`

## Instructions

Each of the methods described below is found in the **Transforms** class.

1. The provided method **flipHoriz(Picture source, Picture target)** flips the image horizontally.

	{: style="text-align: center"}

	> Look at the code given to you for this example
	> carefully.   It is broken into simple steps and the comments help explain why the pixel indexing works.

2. Complete the method **flipVert(Picture source, Picture target)** that flips the image vertically. 

	![](../../../extensions/flipvert.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}

3. Complete the method **flipHorizLeftHalf(Picture source, Picture target)** that flips the left half of the image horizontally.  

	> The left half of the target image should be same as the source, but the right half of the target image should 
	> be the mirror of the left half of the source.

	{: style="text-align: center"}

4. Complete the method **flipVertBotHalf(Picture source, Picture target)** that flips the bottom half of the image vertically.

	![](../../../extensions/flipbottomhalf.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}

5. Complete the method **gradient(Picture target)** that takes a single **Picture**
as a parameter.

	Your code
	should create a **color gradient** by computing the following for each pixel:
	
	* The amount of red in each pixel increases gradually from 0 at the left edge of the image, to 255 at the right edge of the image.  
	* The amount of green in each pixel increases gradually from 0 at the top edge of the image, to 255 at the bottom edge of the image.  
	* The amount of blue in every pixel should be 128.  

	Thus, each pixel will have a different color depending on its position.  For example, the pixel at the top left will have red=0, green=0, and blue=128.  The pixel about 1/4 of the way down on the right edge will have red=255, green=64, and blue=128.  

	> Develop an expression
	> for the amount of red and green in each pixel, given the x and y position of that pixel and the width and height of the image:
	>
	>`int amountRed   = .....`
	>`int amountGreen = ....`
	>
	>Then set the pixel at *(x,y)* to a color based on those computations:
	>
	>`target.set(x, y, new Color(amountRed, amountGreen, 128));`
