In the ListItem class, write methods with the following specifications,
and write thorough JUnit tests to check that they work correctly. 

* A **recursive** method <code>reverseRecurse</code> that takes no parameters and returns a ListItem.  The return value should be a **new** list structure that contains the same numbers as this list, but in the reverse order.  (Hint: Use a helper procedure with an extra parameter that accumulates the reversed list.)  


* An **iterative** method <code>reverseLoop</code> that takes no parameters and returns a ListItem.  The return value should be a **new** list structure that contains the same numbers as this list, but in the reverse order. (Hint: Create a loop variable that\'s a ListItem reference to keep track of your current position in the list.)
