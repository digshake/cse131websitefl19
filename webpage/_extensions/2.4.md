##Background

In this assignment, you have a balance in your bank account and you randomly either deposit or withdraw money from 
your account every day for one month (30 days). At the end of the month, you receive interest on your balance.

##Procedure

1. You start with $4000 in your bank account and earn 2% interest at the end of the month.

2. Each day, you always withdraw or deposit money. Half of the time you **withdraw $100.00** and the other 
half of the time you **deposit $200.50**.

	> How would you use random numbers to determine whether you withdraw or deposit money?

3. After withdrawing or depositing money, calculate your new balance. Then print the following: 
**Day**, **Type**, **Amount**, **Balance** in a cleanly formatted table.


	> Since the cent is the lowest denomination in U.S. currency, round your withdrawals, deposits, and balance 
	> to the nearest cent.


4. Finally, after the 30th day, calculate and print the amount of interest you earned and your final balance.

Your final output should look similar to this:

	1	Deposit 	$200.50		$4200.50
