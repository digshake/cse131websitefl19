We suggest that you wait until you have completed module 5 to do this extension, as the information in module 5 will help. 

Your task is simple: slow down the way that the eyes move from the previous extension. They should still follow the mouse, but it should take some time for the eyes to arrive at their final position.

You are not allowed to do this by slowing the simulation down. Instead, you
must smoothly vary where the eyes should look in the normal speed of the
simulation.
