##Procedure

> To make things simple, let\'s assume that all months have 31 days.

1. Open the `Birthday` class, found in the `arrays` package
	of the `extensions` folder.

2. Insert code to obtain from the user the number of people <I>N</I> that will enter
	the room.

3. For each person, randomly generate a month and day on which that person
	was born.

4. Using a two-dimensional array that is indexed by month and by day,
	keep track of the number of people born on that month and day.

	For example, perhaps you randomly decide the person was born in month 4 and
	day 28.

5. After processing all of the <I>N</I> people, iterate over your array
	to compute:

	* For each month, the fraction (or percentage) of people born in that month.

	* The average of the 12 values you computed for the above.

	* For each day, the fraction (or percentage) of people born on that day, whether in the same or in a different month.

	* The average of the 31 values you computed for the above.

	* The fraction (or percentage) of people born on exactly the same day.

Be careful!  A `1` entry means just one person was born on that particular day.  You are looking for the fraction of people who share a birthday with at least one other person.
