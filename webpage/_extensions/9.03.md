##Overview:
Computers are powerful problem-solving tools, and simulation is a common technique foranalyzing systems whose behavior is beyond the capabilities of simple models or closed formulae. Weather prediction and fluid flow are examples of such systems.  In the work described here, you will simulate the shape of a suspended cable by constructing the cable from masses and springs and allowing gravity and the laws of Newtonian physics to act upon the masses.

More specifically, you construct a model for simulating the shape of a **catenary**:  the shape of our beloved St. Louis [Gateway Arch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch).


##Goals:

By the end of this extension, you should

* Gain more experiences with arrays and lists
* Gain more experience with iteration
* Understand the nature of simulation and approximation in computation science

##Before starting:

* Read over this entire document before you start.
* Ask questions of the instructor and TAs.

##Problem description:

Long before our city began its expansion into the NFL, the pioneers of our country expanded to the West, crossing the Mississippi and braving the perils of midwestern life.  As a monument to their efforts, the City of St. Louis erected [Eero Saarinen](http://www.google.com/search?q=Eero+Saarinen)\'s famous [Arch](http://www.gatewayarch.com/Arch/info/arch.fact.aspx) in 1965.  Its grace, beauty, and elegance have inspired poets, musicians, and artists of the past five decades.

It\'s time that CSE131 had its turn.

A [catenary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary) is the shape made when you suspend a string by holding its ends, and let gravity pull on the string. If you look at a telephone wire strung between two poles, the shape you see is a catenary, though not one that would necessarily garner artistic praise.

It turns out that our Arch is also a catenary, but situated upside down.

How are we to simulate an catenary acting on a string?  If we look really closely at the string, we see that it is composed of a series of mass points, with each adjacent pair of masses connected by a spring.

With gravity turned off, the picture is as follows:

As the simulation proceeds, the catenary takes on the following shapes:

##Notes

* You are given an `ArchController` and `Arch` class to facilitate your
running this program as a GUI.

* Your effort goes into the `Arch` class, specifically:

	* The constructor must set up the simulation.

	* The `round()` method must simulate one round of gravity and springs acting on each mass.

    You can use any data type to represent the masses and/or springs. Wisely you must choose, young padawan, for this choice will affect how much work you will have to put in for the remainder of this extension.

* To obtain consistent results, it is suggested that you simulate movement in two phases within a given round:

	1. First compute where each mass should move at the end of this round, but do not move them. This way, the other mass\'s positions are computed consistently.

	2. Once the new position of all masses are known, have each mass move to its new position.

	It is preferred that you do not account for the momentum of the masses. In the real world, when the masses fall, if they are held  together by springs, they would bounce up and down until eventually the springs turn the kinetic energy of the masses into heat through internal friction. In this code, even if you account for momentum AND friction, it is very hard to get the masses to settle. So instead, for every `round()` calculate where the mass should be based on the force of gravity and the springs, and move it there. 

* Think of the resolution of this project in terms of the number of  masses that are used in the simulation. Make sure that the sum  of the masses is constant, no matter how many masses you use, so that the cable has constant total mass no matter how many point masses (rectangles in the picturse) you use in the simulation.

* A spring obeys [Hook\'s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law).

* To receive credit, you must be able to change certain properties of the simulation.  See the list of questions below for more detail, and be sure to parameterizse your simulation so that these are easily changed.

##To receive credit
       
Be prepared to answer the following questions when you demo:

1. What happens when the spring constant is large?

2. Why do the masses continue to wiggle, even after the Arch seems finished?

3. What happens when you have more masses, but the same gravity and spring constant?

4. What happens when gravity increases?

**Extra fun:** Modify your solution so that the Arch starts at the bottom of the screen, and falls up instead of down.
