[Conway\'s Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a biology simulation that was developed by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is designed to simulate cellular automation by creating an initial configuration of living and dead cells and observing how they evolve. Many interesting patterns have developed from the origins of the original simulation--producing patterns that pulsate, exist into infinity, and even glide like spaceships.

The rules of Conway\'s Game of life are as follows:

* If a living cell has fewer than two living neighbors, it dies of loneliness
* If a living cell has more than three living neighbors it dies of overcrowding
* If a living cell has two or three neighbors, it continues to live
* If a dead cell has exactly three living neighbors, it is resurrected by friendship

This set of rules can end up making some very interesting patterns. Below we have drawn out some of the patterns that are made by cells in Conway\'s game of life. Dead cells are represented by white squares, living cells are represented by black squares.

##Directions

In this extension, you will be responsible for building the simulator portion of Conway\'s Game of Life (henceforth known as Conway, or Life). You can then run the game on your own patterns or on patterns that we provide.

The code for this work can be found `conway` package of the `extensions` source folder. The `Conway` class is where you will be doing all of your work. `ConwayTest` is the tester for `Conway` and `Main` is what you will run when your code is finished to actually see your work happen. The `Main` class creates a GUI, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interface</a>, which allows you to see cells dying and coming back to life. Open `Conway`. You will create the following methods:

1. A `public Conway(int rows, int cols)` constructor that specifies the dimensions of the Conway board. 

2. A `public int getRows()` method, that is an accessor.

3. A `public int getColumns()` method, that is an accessor 

	Your code should now pass the `getRowsAndColumnsTest()`

4. A `public void setLiveness(boolean b, int row, int col)` method that takes in a row and a column, and whether that cell should be currently alive or dead

	It would make sense that if a cell was alive, and it was represented by a boolean, it would be `true`, and if it was dead it would be `false`. You must come up with a data type that stores values in rows an columns to represent all of the cells. There are multiple ways to store this information, but think carefully about which one you choose, for this choice could save you time down the road. Just remember; you should not change anything within the test, and you must return what we ask you to return. 

5. An `public boolean isAlive(int row, int col)` method, which returns whether the cell at that specific row and column is alive or dead. If the row and column are out of the bounds of that Conway object, then return false.

	Your code should now pass the `isAliveTest()` and the `setLivenessTest()`.

6. A `public void clear()` method, which sets every cell in the Conway object to dead.

	Your code should now pass the `clearTest()`

7. A `public int countLivingNeighbors(int row, int col)` method, which considers the cell at a certain row and column, and returns the number of living neighbors that it has.

	The neighbors of a certain cell are considered to be the eight cells that are surrounding it. Your `isAlive()` should help you with this.
	
	<TABLE>
	<TR><TD><IMG SRC="../../../extensions/3by3box.gif"> </TD><TD>If you were to count the number of living neighbors of the living cell in the picture above, you would check the eight white squares that are surrounding it, and see if any of those cells were alive. In this picture, the live cell in the middle has no living neighbors, so according to the rules, it will die of loneliness. So in the next frame it will become a white square. </TD></TR>
	<TR><TD><IMG SRC="../../../extensions/4x4BoxFilled.gif" ></TD>
	<TD>This is a random group of cells</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR><TD><IMG SRC="../../../extensions/4x4BoxNumbers.gif"></TD>
	<TD>This picture shows the number of living neighbors that each of the cells in the above picture has </TD>
	</TR>
	</TABLE>

	Once you implement this method, your code should pass the `countLivingNeighborsTest()`

8. A `public void step()` method, which executes a generation of life. What this means is that you take all of the cells from the `this` Conway object, and determine whether or not they will be alive in the next generation. 

	It might be helpful here to create a `next` conway object with the same dimensions as the `this` Conway object. If you change the values of the original Conway object while you still havent determined whether other cells will be alive in the next generation, you might not count the wrong number of living neighbors. For instance, say cell A and cell B both alive, and are neighbors. If you determine that A will be dead in the next generation, and you kill it, when you go to count the number of living neighbors of B, it will have fewer living neighbors now than it should. If you create another Conway object, you can store the liveness of ALL of the cells on that Conway object, and then alter the values of the `this` Conway object at the end.

	If a cell will not be alive in the next generation, set it to `false`. If a cell will be alive in the next generation, set it to `true`. Make sure to account for all cells, and not just the ones that are currently alive. The rules of the Conway Game of Life are listed at the top of this page. This is where you will implement those rules.


	Your code should now pass the `stepTest()` 

In the code, we have `public void yourDesginOne()` and `public void yourDesginTwo()`. You
 do not have to fill these out for the code to work, but if you want to create a pattern, you can create it here, and 
 you will be able to access it through the GUI. These will be used for the next extension

The following methods are provided for you, do not change any of these:

1. `public void blinker()` allows the GUI to create a blinker pattern

2. `public void fourBlinkers()` allows the GUI to create a four-blinker pattern

3. `public void gosperGliderGun()` allows the GUI to create a gosperGliderGun pattern

4. `public void glider()` allows the GUI to create a glider pattern

5. Other supporting classes, including the visualization code, are in the `labsupport` source folder.  They are moved there to reduce the clutter in the extensions folder.


There is also an empty `public void logAndCapture()` method. You do not need to put anything in here right now, 
this is the subject of the next extension

Once you have completed all the methods, you can run the `Main` method to play Conway\'s Game of Life.

To further debug your code, the visual interface allows you to take one step
at a time. If the game is not working, use the debugger or print information helpful to
diagnosing the problems you see.

###To Demo

Your code must pass all of the unit tests, and the GUI should work, and be able to display cells interacting with eachother.
