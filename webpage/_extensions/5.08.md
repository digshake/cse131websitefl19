# Description

Your goal in this extension is to create a memory matching game using `StdDraw` and your growing computer 
science knowledge. If you\'ve never played a memory matching game before, you can find a truck themed one 
<a href="http://www.sproutonline.com/games/bill-boards-memory-match" target="new"> here </a>
to get the general idea. Additionally, you can find a video demoing a solution 
<a href="Extensions/memorymatch.mp4" target="new">here</a>.

In this extension, you are going to create a matching game that uses colors rather than images. It should do the following:

##Procedure

1. Generate a 4-by-4 grid of clearly distinguishable tiles (you can change your design later to accommodate any even number of tiles if you want, but 4x4 is the base requirement).

2. The board should be made up of randomly distributed pairs of colored tiles (8 pairs in total); all of these colors are initially hidden. You are welcome to choose the colors yourself, or come up with some way of auto-generating them as long as they are all easily distinguishable from each other. For example, it would not be recommended to use the light gray, gray, and dark gray default `Color`s together. Note that the distribution of colored tiles on the board should change from game to game, but the actual colors need not.

3. Tiles should start out hidden and should reveal their concealed color when clicked. When a single tile is clicked, it should remain visible until a second is selected. If that second selected tile does not conceal the same color as the first tile then, after a reasonable delay, both tiles should revert to hidden. If the second tile is the same color as the first tile, then both tiles can either remain flipped or simply disappear. The process then repeats. 

4. The game must keep track of score. You can do this by either counting the number of clicks it takes before the full board is revealed or timing it. Once the game is over, the score should be displayed on the `StdDraw` canvas somewhere.

5. After the game is over, a single click to the `StdDraw` canvas should start a new game (the player shouldn\'t need to re-run the program to play again).

Be aware that the `(0,0)` coordinate on the `StdDraw` canvas is in the **lower**-left corner while we generally depict the `[0][0]` index of a two dimensional array in the **upper**-left, as shown in the drawing below in blue and black respectively. If you store information in arrays, you want to have consistency between the way that information is stored and viewed, e.g. `(0,0)` should correspond to the same area as `[0][0]`. You can do this however you like, but it\'s recommended that you change the scale of the `StdDraw` canvas so that its coordinates match those of the array. This can be accomplished with the method, `StdDraw.setYscale(double bottomValue, double topValue)`.

Below are the methods you must complete. You are welcome to write additional methods 
to help accomplish this assignment.

`Color[][] genBoard()` 

Generates a new board with 8 different color pairs and returns the 4x4 `Color` matrix with randomized locations. Must pass the unit test for credit.

`void drawBoard(Color[][] board)` 

Rescales the canvas as described above and draws the hidden or flipped tiles that are in play.

`boolean isOver(Color[][] board)`

Checks to see if all the matches have been found.

`double[] click()`

Waits for a mouse to click and release and then returns an array with the click\'s x and y coordinates.

`void playGame()`

Plays the game until it is over and then waits for a click to start a new one, at which point it generates a new board.

In this extension, you are going to need while loops that will run indefinitely, waiting for some input from the player. You **must** use the `StdDraw.pause(int msec)` method to give your computer a break. If you don\'t, the computer will waste resources doing absolutely nothing. Below is some sample code to demonstrate what this looks like:</p>


		while(!StdDraw.mousePressed()) {  // waiting on a click
			StdDraw.pause(80);
		}
		// Do something...	



Don\'t forget that in order to actually run your game you will need a `main` method.
