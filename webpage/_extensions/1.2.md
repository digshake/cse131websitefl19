## Background

### Pixels

The word *pixel* stands for Picture Element. A pixel is a small part
of a picture. Pixels are the little dots that make up LCD
screens. When you see a low-resolution picture that is grainy, the
grain you\'re seeing are the pixels.

### Representing color in Java

Pixels are made up of 3 colors: red, green, and blue (hence the
term *RGB*). The color of a pixel is made up of a combination of the
*intensities* of each of red, green, and blue components. Intensities range from 0 (meaning none of that color is present) to 255
(meaning as much as possible of that color is present). You
declare a new pixel by coding 

```
new Color(redValue, greenValue,blueValue)
```

where **redValue** is the intensity (an integer between 0 and 255) of 
red, **greenValue** is the intensity of green, and **blueValue** is the intensity of blue.<br>


For example, you get the color black with `new Color (0,0,0)` (0
intensity for all colors). You get red with `new Color (255,0,0)`
(highest intesity for red, 0 intensity for green and blue).

### Filters

This work involves writing a number of filters that are applied to
images to achieve a given result.  There are two kinds of methods that
you complete, and each is described below:

`int foo(int pixelComponent)`

Methods with the above signature take in a single pixel component
intensity value:  an integer between 0 and 255 inclusively.
They are obligated to return an intensity value as their result.

These methods are used by the course software as shown below:

![Color Intensity](../../../extensions/colorintensity.jpg)
{: style="text-align: center"}

1. A **Color** object is broken into its red, green, and blue
components.
2. Each component is passed to your **foo** method, and the
result of that function is retained.
3. The three results are combined into a new **Color** object.

In other words, the **foo** function is used as a filter on each
of a **Color**\'s components.  The **foo** function is unaware
of which component it is processing:  it treats each equally.

`Color bar(Color c)`

Methods with the above signature accept and produce a standard Java
**[Color](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html)** object.  These methods can themselves decompose a **Color**
object into its components and create a resulting **Color** object
to achieve whatever effect is desired.
 
## Project: Image Processing Methods

1. In Eclipse, open the **extensions** source folder and
then open the **imageprocessor** package. Find and open the
**ImageProcessor** class.

	> This is the *main* program you run to see the results of your work.
	> 
	> Go ahead and run it as a Java application.
	> You should see a window pop up with
	> some images preloaded.

	
2. Try the *darker* filter.  It has been implemented for you, and
it should produce an image in the *Target* window that resembles
the image in the *source1* window, but is a bit darker.
3. Try the *combine* filter.  It has also been implemented but
its effects may seem a bit strange.  You will soon implement a smarter version
of this kind of a filter.
4. The other methods are not yet implemented, but you are free to try
them.

	> By the way, you can drag images between the icon panel at the top and the working
	> panels in the middle, or *vice versa*, so that you can manipulate
	> other images than the ones that are preloaded.
	>
	> You can also load your own images by clicking on the icon that resembles
	> a *plus* sign.

## Directions:
First, right click on the **ImageProcessorTest** class, and **Run As** a **JUnit Test**.

> * On the left you should see a whole bunch of 
> test names with red or blue x\'s by them, indicating that they are not being passed. * Every time you complete a piece of code correctly, one of the tests will pass, 
> and a small green x will appear beside it. 
> * Once all of the tests pass, a satisfying green bar will appear in place of the red one that you see now. You will 
> not get this green bar in this extension, though, because you will not be doing any work on the **bgSubtract** or **bdReplace** methods. 
> To get the green bar you must go on to the next extension.

Now open the **Filters** class and begin your work as described
below.  

> It is strongly suggested that you re-run the unit test, and run **ImageProcessor** to test each filter after its
> completion before you move on to the next filter.  This will ensure that you are making progress and not going down a wrong path.

Complete the provided stub
methods as described below.
In the method bodies, **use mathematical expressions**. Do *not* use
a conditional (if) statement.

### Intensity filters

> Use **no conditional execution** for this part:  only arithmetic expressions
> as you have learned them in Module 1.

1. Complete the method called *copy*, so that each
provided intensity value is copied exactly
from the source to the target panel.

	>Hint: This is a *very* simple method.

	![](../../../extensions/copy.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
    
2. Complete the method that will *composite* the images
in the
two source panels by averaging their components. This method accepts two
parameters, which are color components from the two source panels.

	![](../../../extensions/composite.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
	
3. Complete the method called *negative* that will
produce the
negative image by inverting the intensity of each component. 

	>For
	>example, if the parameter value is 0, you should return 255. If the
	>parameter value is 1, you should return 254, and so on.

	![](../../../extensions/negative.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}

4. Complete the method *posterize* that will reduce the
number of possible colors in an image. For a given color component, your
method will choose between
two intensities, 0 or 255, which correspond to that color component
being turned off or on completely. 
So, since each color has three
components (red, green, and blue), you will end up with an image that
has only 8 different colors. 

	> Remember that you are *not*
	> allowed to use conditionals (if) statements for this part of the lab.
	> 
	> *Hint:* : Recall that color components
	> are in the range 0-255. Also, recall that if you divide an int by
	> another int, the result number will be truncated. For example, 
	> **130 / 128 =& 1**, but 
	> **125 / 128 =& 0**.

	{: style="text-align: center"}


### **Color** filters

Note that each pixel
of an image is represented as a [Color](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html)
object.

> * Continue to
> use **no conditional execution** for this part:  only arithmetic expressions
> as you have learned them in Module 1.
> * To create a new **Color**, you must specify its red, green, and blue components in that order.  For example
> 
> `Color c = new Color(25,128,0);`
> 
> declares **c** to be a color with some red (25 out of 255), half of the possible green, and no blue.
> * If you have a **Color c**, then you can get its red, green, and blue components as follows:
>
> `int red   = c.getRed();`
> `int green = c.getGreen();`
> `int blue  = c.getBlue();`

Create and test methods (whose parameters and return values are <code>Color</code>s)
with the following specifications.

1. Complete the method *brighter* that will return, for
each pixel, a Color that is brighter than
the original. 

	> The 
	> **[Color](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html)**
	> class makes this easy because it already
	> provides a 
	> <a href="">[brighter\(\)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html#brighter%28%29)
	> method that returns a brighter color.
	>
	> If **c** is a color, then **c.brighter()** is a brighter version of **c**\'s color.


	![](../../../extensions/brighter.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
	
2. Complete the method *grayscale* that will make a
grayscale image from a color image.
To do this, you will take in one Color parameter (the Color object for
a pixel from the original image) and
will produce a new Color in which all the components (red, green, and
blue) have the same value.

	> Hint: To choose which value, average the three components of the
	> original color.

	![](../../../extensions/grayscale.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
  
### More **Color** filters

OK, now you can use **if** statements!


1. Complete the method *blackAndWhite* that produces a
black and white image by returning, for each pixel, a **Color** that is
either black or white, depending upon the overall intensity of the
original color. 

	For your return value, use the constant **Color.BLACK**
	or **Color.WHITE**. It\'s up to you how to decide when a
	color\'s components, taken as a whole, should be considered black or
	white.

	![](../../../extensions/blackandwhite.png)
	{: style="text-align: center"}
	
2. Complete the method *combineBrighter* that combines
two images by choosing for each pixel the color from the image that has
the brighter pixel in that location. To determine which pixel is
brighter, compare the sums of the red, green, and blue components of
the two pixels. Since the ProcessorTool will run your method for every
pair of pixels, the resulting image will have some pixels from the
first image and some from the second image.
