##Intro
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">Web scrapers</a> are programs that search websites and scrape off useful data.  You will write a web scraper in this assignment that looks for weather information in a zip code of interest.  There are two ways to go about this:

* The result of accessing a web URL is a stream of text which you can receive a a Java `String`.  You can scan that `String` for information of interest.  In this approach, you search for features that delimit the area of interest, and trim the `String` to extract data of interest.

* A library has been developed for Java called [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) that allows  direct interaction with a website\'s HTML.  This library regards a web document in terms of its structure.  You use methods from this library to navigate to the part of the web page that is of interest.

##URLs and web sites

* Watch <a href="../../../extensions/scraping1.mp4">this video</a> which
demonstrates how URLs are used in the [http://www.wunderground.com/](http://www.wunderground.com/" target="weather") web site.

* We have to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineer</a> how that web site uses URLs to request zip-code-specific weather information.
	
	* After watching the video, visit the [http://www.wunderground.com/](http://www.wunderground.com/" target="weather") site

	* Take a look around for a bit to see what is offered there

	* Type into the field `Search Locations`  some zip code of interest to you.  Examples might include:

		* [63130](http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=63130" target="weather") for Washington University
		* [80424](http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=80424" target="weather") for Breckenridge, Colorado
		* [10598](http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=10598" target="weather") for Yorktown Height, New York

	* Observe that when you submit your request, you are taken to a web page whose URL is different from the home page for the site.

* Try editing the URL in your browser to find weather information for a different zip code of interest to you.

* For one or more of the pages you reach, view the source of that web page in your browser, as you saw in the video.

	Browsers vary in how they allow you to see the page source.  If you are on the web page of interest, try control- (right-) clicking and one option you should see should resemble `View Page Source`.

	If you are lost, try <a href="http://www.google.com">Googling</a> for how to view page source in your browser.


* Try to locate the text within the page source that corresponds to the temperature report.  In the video, this was found near the string `curTemp` in the source.

##Simple use of `jsoup`

* Watch <a href="../../../extensions/scraping2.mp4">this video</a> which shows how to supply `jsoup` with  a URL within Java.

* The result of that interaction is a `String`.

In this assignment, you will process the text yourself after getting the document\'s text using `jsoup`.  You could use methods in `jsoup` to isolate what you need, but you can explore that on your own.

##Procedure

* Find and open the `Weather` class in the `scraping` project of your `extensions` folder.

* That code is what you saw on the video, with comments added to direct your work.

* Your task is essentially to isolate the temperature data and some other statistic from the source text of the web page.

	What makes this difficult is that the author of the web page doesn\'t know
	you want to find this information.  

	You have to look at the web page yourself
	to find distinguishing features of the page near where you want to extract
	information.

	Worse still, the author of that web page is not obligated to keep the
	information you see in future versions of that web page.  Scraping is a
	dodgy effort at best, and you may have to revise your code in response to
	changes made by the author of the pages you scrape.

* It will be helpful to use some methods from the [String](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html") class.  The following describes some of those methods, assuming they are called on a target `String t`.

<br>

[int indexof(String str)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf%28java.lang.String%29" target="doc")

: Finds the location of the specified `str` in `t`.

<br>

[String substring(int beginIndex)](href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#substring%28int%29" target="doc")

: Returns a new `String` that is copied from `t`, starting
at the supplied `beginIndex`.

<br>

[String substring(int beginIndex, endIndex)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#substring%28int,%20int%29" target="doc")

: Returns a new `String` that is the substring of `t`, starting
at the supplied `beginIndex`, up to but not including `endIndex`.

##Demo

* Complete the code as instructed in the comments.

* Your output must include the current temperature and some other statistic of interest from that same web page.

* Show the output to your TA.
