Implement deletion properly in your binary search tree.  In particular, suppose you want to remove node **x** from the tree.

1. If **x** is a leaf, let **x**\'s parent refer to null instead.
2. If **x** has only one child,  let **x**\'s parent refer to **x**\'s child instead.
3. In the difficult case, when **x** has two children, you can replace **x** in the tree by the rightmost element in **x**\'s left subtree.
