Computer science plays a large role in modern biology.  BioJava is a framework for working with biological data.  It provides a framework for using sequences and performing common biology functions.  In this extension you will be reading in a DNA sequence and computing its 
GC-Content(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC-content).

###Notes
* You can find the Java files for this extension in the `extensions` source folder.

	>Locate the following files in the `biojavagc` package:
	> * `GCContent.java` is the file you complete.  When you run it,
	> analysis is performed on four genomes and the results are printed as output.
	>
	> * `GCContentTest.java` is a unit test for your work.  You will
	> receive credit for this extension only if this test passes.

* You can do this extension by following the instructions below.
However, you might want to take some time to familiarize yourself with the  [BioJava website](http://biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page).  
Of special importance is the [BioJava Cookbook](http://biojava.org/wiki/BioJava:CookBook).  The cookbook 
  has information and examples for performing common tasks.  You may also find the [BioJava API](http://www.biojava.org/docs/api/index.html) helpful.

* You will be working with some DNA sequences,
represented in the [FASTA format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format),
which you can find in the `genomes` folder of your workspace:

	* `NC_002677.fasta`
	* `mysterya.fasta`
	* `mysteryb.fasta`
	* `mysteryc.fasta`

	> As you might guess from their names, there is an air of mystery surrounding
	> some of these genomes.
	> 
	> Consider a bacterium and a phage that might be hosted by that
	> bacterium.  It turns out that the DNA of the host and of the phage often need
	> to be similar in terms of their GC content for the bacterium to play host
	> to the phage:
	> 
	> Most bacteriophage and other bacteria are lower in GC content than Salmonella and its relatives, so invading DNA is an obvious target for H-NS. &quot;It\'s like a primitive immune system,&quot; says Fang. &quot;Reduce their expression, and the foreign genes can be tolerated.&quot;
	> 
	> From [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2064161/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2064161/)

	In other words, if the GC content in the bacterium and phage is dissimilar, the bacterium may be
	immune to infection by the phage.

##Procedure
1. Complete the method `percentGC`  in `GCContent`.

	> Note: BioJava already has a function to get the GC-count (number of G and C nucleotides) of a sequence.  
	>
	> **Do not use this function.**
	>
	> Instead, devise a way to
	> iterate through the array of characters (representing nucleotides) yourself.  

2. Run the unit test `GCContentTest`  and make sure it passes.

	> Most students\' code fails when given a string with no DNA in it whatsover
	> (an empty string or `""`.  Its GC content is 0%.
