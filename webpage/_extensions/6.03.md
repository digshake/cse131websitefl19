In the `extensions` folder open the `recursivepatterns` package.  
The following classes found there, and described in greater detail below, must
be completed for this extension:

* `TransparentColor` 

* `Flower`

The ultimate goal is to complete the `flower` method of the
`Flower` class so that it draws an image similar to the one
shown below:

![](../../../extensions/flower.png)

The colors shown in the above image are somewhat *transparent*, so that
the color of an ellipse is allowed to bleed through the ellipse above it.

You can proceed by working on either class first.  However, if you postpone
`TransparentColor`, you will see solid colors in your flower until
you have completed that class.

##Details

`TransparentColor`

: As is the case with most color models, Java\'s 
	[Color](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html) 
	objects
	are allowed to have a degree of transparency.

	The `transparentColor` method, as provided to you, ignores the
	`alpha` parameter and returns the color provided as input.

	You must change this behavior so that the color returned as the same
	red, green, and blue components as the provided color, but with the
	specified transparency.

	Java makes this easy, because there is a constructor for
	[Color](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html) 
	that does the job.
	This task is given to you primarily to acquaint you with the process of looking
	through JavaDoc documentation to find a class or method you need.

	Follow the instructions provided in the `TransparentColor` source code.

	Before moving on, test your code by running `TransparentColor` as
	a Java Application.  You should see the colors solid at the upper right of
	the drawing window, and blended (more transparent) at the lower left.


`Flower`

: Your task here is to complete the `flower` method, whose parameters
	are described in the JavaDoc for the method.  Some useful guildines follow:

	* The `StdDraw` class offers a `filledEllipse` method,
		but you must set the color before calling it.
	* You should choose a random color for each ellipse you draw, and you are
		provided a `palette` of `Color` objects as input to
		your `flower` method.

		If necessary, review the material in the text and slides that discusses how
		to pick a random integer.  You would use that integer to index the
		`palette` array.

	* You must find the substructure in the flower pattern.  To help
		with this, the following
		diagram shows the locations of each ellipse within a given level of recursion:

	![](../../../extensions/five-recursive-calls.jpg)

	* Analyze the above diagrams to infer the area taken up by each sub-ellipse
		that you must draw.

	* Remember that the `StdDraw` coordinate system has (0,0) at the 
		lower-left, and (1,1) at the upper right.

	* Remember that `StdDraw` shapes take a center as their primary
		coordinate, and use half-widths and half-lengths for dimensions.

As usual, ask for help as needed.
