## Warm Up

To understand this extension, you should first be familiar with the 
extension in which an instrument\'s sound is produced as the sum of
sine waves.

You will modify your program further in this extension to produce the sine-wave
plots that depict how sine-wave addition occurs.

The details of this assignment are not completely specified so that
you must think through what is needed to produce meaningful plots.
Ask for help as needed!

##Procedure

* An example of a plot is shown below:

![](../../../extensions/instr.jpg)

* The black waveform with the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude">amplitude</a> (the tallest black waveform) is the fundamental frequency at relative strength 1.  The waves shown are for 1/440 of a second of a 440 Hz concert-A.  This is sufficient ot show one full cycle of that fundamental frequency.

* The black waveform with the next largest amplitude has relative strength 0.75.  It is
an octave higher, so it oscillates twice in the timespan of the
fundamental pitch\'s waveform, at 880 Hz.

* The black waveform of smallest amplitude (at half the strength of the fundamental frequency) is 660 Hz: the 3:2 frequency factor, which sounds like a fifth above the fundamental frequency.  As expected, it exhibits  1.5 cycles in the timespan of the fundamental pitch\'s waveform.

* The red waveform is the sum of the black ones.

* Each of the frequency factors incorporated into an instrument is shown separately by plotting dots of the curve as the values are computed.

* With frequencies on the order of hundereds or thousands of cycles per second, we must limit the time of the plot so that we can see one or two cycles clearly.

Think about how many **samples** you need to capture to show
one complete cycle at 440 Hz.  

One way to reason about this is to use
the units of the various computations and multiply or divide them to obtain
the property you seek.

* Plot the individual waveforms using black dots, as shown above.

* Plot the summation waveform using red connected line segments, as shown
	above.
