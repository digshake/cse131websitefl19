## Overview

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">
Machine learning</a> is an area of study in computer science that falls
within the larger area of study known as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>.
Here, we are trying to <EM>teach</EM> a computer to reason about a problem
based on data we provide.

One such simple task to consider is learning a geometric line, as characterized
by its slope and y-intercept.  Where two properties are related linearly,
the line that characterizes their relationship can be used to predict the
relationship between values that have not yet been seen. How many points
must be provided to learn a line? From geometry we know that two distinct points determine a line.

More generally we have data that behaves in an approximately linear manner, and we seek to learn the line that best characterizes, or best fits, our data.

Thus, the simple form of machine learning we study here is <EM>linear regression</EM>. This technique allows us to take many data points with two known variables, learn the line that best fits their relationship, and then predict the value of one variable when given the other. 

Once your assignment is complete, you can run on the
the actual selling prices and square footages of thousands of houses in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida" target="_blank">Broward County, Florida</a> area. You can then estimate the price of any house in that area based on its square footage, assuming that square footage is linearly related to the price of the house.

## Procedure

<OL>
<LI> Your work for this assignment can be found in the <KBD>learnline</KBD>
package in your repository.
<LI> You begin by completing the <KBD>RunningSum</KBD> class.
The idea of this class is that every time <KBD>add(value)</KBD> is called, the
specified <KBD>value</KBD> is incorporated into a running sum.  The class
also keeps track of the <EM>number</EM> of values incorporated into the sum, so that
the average of all those values can also be computed and returned by a method
in the class.

For example, suppose we start out with the following code:
<PRE>
RunningSum xs = new RunningSum()
xs.add(3)
xs.add(5)
</PRE>
then 
<UL>
 <LI> <KBD>xs.getSum()</KBD> returns 8</LI>
 <LI> <KBD>xs.getCount()</KBD> returns 2</LI>
 <LI> <KBD>xs.getAvg()</KBD> returns 4</LI>
</UL>

If the code continues
<PRE>
xs.add(10)
</PRE>
then
<UL>
 <LI> <KBD>xs.getSum()</KBD> returns 18</LI>
 <LI> <KBD>xs.getCount()</KBD> returns 3</LI>
 <LI> <KBD>xs.getAvg()</KBD> returns 6</LI>
</UL>

Complete the <KBD>RunningSum</KBD> class.
<LI> Make sure the 
<KBD>RunningSumTest</KBD> class passes all of its tests.

<LI> Find and open the <KBD>LinearRegression</KBD> class.  This class is
structured so that it can continually 
accept <KBD>x</KBD> and <KBD>y</KBD> values using the method
<PRE>
void accept(double x, double y)
</PRE>
Moreover, at any time the method <KBD>getSlope()</KBD> or
<KBD>getIntercept()</KBD> can be called.  You must respond by using the
computation described below to return the slope or y-intercept of the best-fit
line based on the values you have accepted so far.
 <LI> You will implement the simple linear regression formula shown below. 

 More information on how the formula should be used can be found

<UL>
<LI>
The notation  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline"><I>x</I></SPAN> means
the <EM>average</EM> of all of the <I>x</I> values accepted so far.</LI>
<LI> The notation <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline"><I>xy</I></SPAN> 
means the average of the products formed by multiplying  each point's <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> values.</LI>
</UL>

You will use <KBD>RunningSum</KBD> objects to keep track of
<UL>
  <LI> The sum of all <KBD>x</KBD> values seen so far.</LI>
  <LI> The sum of all <KBD>y</KBD> values seen so far.</LI>
  <LI> The sum of all <KBD>x&times;y</KBD> products seen so far.</LI>
  <LI> The sum of the squares of all <KBD>x</KBD> values seen so far.</LI>
</UL>
<LI> Provision for the <KBD>RunningSum</KBD>s needed to keep track
of the values as described above.  Declare them at the top of the
<KBD>LinearRegression</KBD> class as <KBD>private</KBD> instance variables
and be sure to initialize them in the constructor.
<LI> Find and implement the <KBD>accept(x,y)</KBD> method in the 
<KBD>LinearRegression</KBD> class using the info above.
<LI>Finish the code for the <kbd>predictY(x)</kbd> method. 
This method should allow a user to pass in a value for <KBD>x</KBD>, and return a value for <KBD>y</KBD> based on the best-fit line.
Your solution should use the <KBD>getSlope()</KBD> and <KBD>getIntercept()</KBD>
methods.

Make sure you pass the <kbd>testPredictions</kbd> JUnit test.
<LI> When you finish, you can try using the <kbd>Interactive</kbd> class 
and click on points to see the best-fit line emerge.
<LI> Demo your results to a TA to receive credit.
