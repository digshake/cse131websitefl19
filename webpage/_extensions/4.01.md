# Bouncing Balls

In this extension you will simulate multiple bouncing balls, that may bump
into each other or into the wall.  The steps articulated below for completing
this lab recommend that you develop the code in stages, so that you can test
as you go and make sure you are on the right track.

You have the knowledge you need to do this extension, but the assignment
is written-up in a style usually seen for software specification:  you are
told what should happen, but it\'s up to you to make it happen.

As always, consult with TAs when you are stuck.

## Resources

* Do your work in the `bouncingballs` package of the `extensions` source folder, in the `BouncingBalls` class.

* While there is some physics required for this lab, the information you need to know is simply the following:

	* Two balls are colliding if the distance between the two balls\' centers is less than the sum of the two balls\' radii:

	> 
	> * Image from **http://kahshiu.wordpress.com/page/2/**
	> * **Ar** and **Br** are the radii of the two balls.
	> * **dist** is the distance between the two balls\' centers.


* The distance between two points can be computed using the [distance formula](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/distform.htm)

# Description

1. Prompt the user for the number of balls that will be simulated in your program and the number of iterations for the simulation.

2. For each ball, find a random place on the screen to place that ball.

3. For each ball, compute a random velocity for that ball.

	> Based on what you have learned so far in this course, how will you keep
	> track of the balls\' positions and velocities?


4. Finding a reasonable range of velocities may require some trial-and-error, or
some thinking and experimentation using pencil and paper:

    * If the balls move too fast, they might fly off the screen.
    * If they move too slowly, the simulation will take forever for you to see something.

5. Iterate the specified number of times, each time recomputing
each ball\'s location

6. When a ball collides with a wall, change its velocity. For this assignment you can assume that all collisions are elastic (velocity is retained, only the direction changes).

7. When a ball collides with another ball, change both its horizontal and
vertical velocity component, as if the ball hit a corner of the screen.
