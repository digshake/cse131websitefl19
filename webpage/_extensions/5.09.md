##Present Value

In this assignment, we consider and reason about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time value of money</a>.  
This is based on the observations:

* While we live in the present, we understand the value of
	\$1 in terms of what it can buy today.

* It\'s difficult for us to think of what a dollar
	could buy 100 years ago, or 100 years from now.

* If we want to compare monetary values from several time periods,
	it is helpful to view them in the same time period.



The suggestion is therefore to reason about all currency in *today\'s dollars*.  This is called *present value*.

The ideas discussed here are widely used in economics, finanace, and
accounting.

##Two Friends and your \$1
Suppose you have \$1 and two friends who offer to take your dollar under the
following circumstances:

| **Friend One** 
	
This friend takes your \$1 
and gives you back \$5 tomorrow.

| **Friend Two**

This friend takes your \$1 and gives you 
back \$10 in fifty years.

Which friend is offering you the better deal?  

* If we consider only the number of dollars you receive from these
	two friends, then in 50 years you end up with either \$5, 
	or \$10.
	
* It may therefore seem that Friend Two is offering you the better deal.

* However, we know that \$10 fifty years from now is 
	not worth \$10 today.

How do we reason about the value of \$10 in fifty years?  We must first model
how the value of money changes over time.  We do this by choosing:

* a time period during which the money\'s value stays the same, and at the
end of which money grows instantaneously by some factor *r*

	For this exercise, we choose a year\'s time, so that money changes
	value annually.

* the factor *r*, which is interchangeably called
	the *discount rate*, *opportunity cost of capital*, and
	*rate of return*.
	
	For this exercise, we choose 10% growth so that 
	*r&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.1*.



We then use the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money">time value of money</a> 
to compute the following:

* What would \$1 be worth in fifty years if invested with some
	rate of return *r*?

	We model this computation by the function

	```
	futureValue(dollars, years, r) = dollars * (1.0 + r) ^ years
	```

	Thus, \$1 is the same now 
	as \$117 dollars fifty years from now.

* How much would I have to set aside today so that it would be worth
	\$1 in fifty years using the discount
	rate *r*?


	We model this computation by computing the reverse (running time backwards)
	of what we computed for the future:

	```
	presentValue(dollars, years, r) = dollars / (1.0 + r) ^ years
	```

	Thus, to have \$1 fifty years from now, we would have to set aside
	0.854 cents (less than one cent) now.

Returning to your two friends, let\'s relate both friends\' offers in terms
of present value, and compute your profit or loss (your *net* result).

##Net Present Value

Recall we assume a discount rate of 10% (`r=0.10`) and we regard
time annually.

| **Friend One** 

* This friend takes your \$1 and gives 
	you back \$5 tomorrow.  

* With money changing
	value annually, \$5 tomorrow 
	is the same as \$5 today.  

* Computing

	```
	presentValue(\$5, 0, 0.10) = \$5 / (1.0 + 0.10) ^ 0
	```
	
	yields \$5.
	
* This friend\'s offer is therefore worth \$5 today. 

* Your *net* gain is the \$5 you receive *minus* the \$1 you gave 
	away, so you net \$4.

Because your *net present value* from this deal is positive (\$5), you would choose
to take advantage of this friend\'s offer.


**Friend Two**

* This friend takes your \$1 and gives 
	you back \$10 in a fifty years.

* \$10 in fifty years sounds 
	better than \$5 tomorrow, but &hellip;

* Computing

	```
	presentValue(\$10, 50, 0.10) = \$10 / (1.0 + 0.10) ^ 50
	```

	offer is worth about 8 cents today. 
 
* Your *net* gain is the 0.08 dollars
	you receive minus the \$1 you gave away, so you net &minus;0.92 dollars.

	Because your *net present value* is negative (&minus;0.92), you would decline
	this friend\'s offer.

## Product Development Story

Consider the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value#Example">example from Wikipedia</a>,
based on investing \$100,000 to create a new product:

* The product would cost you \$100,000 to develop.  That money would be gone forever.

* Every year for the next 12 years, you would receive \$10,000 from sales
	of the product.

In summary, you give away \$100,000 and 
	you get \$120,000 back.  Is this 
	a good deal?  Let\'s look at the returns in terms of Net Present Value (NPV):

The NPV of the \$100,000 investment is &minus;31,863.09, which is a substantial loss.
Because the NPV is negative, this is not an investment you should make.
