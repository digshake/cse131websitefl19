## Introduction

You have written the recursive function for the
[Fibonacci Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in studio.  In this extension, you will
compare the running time of that recursive formulation with an
iterative formulation of the same function.

## Procedure

*  Find the `fibonacci` package in the `extensions`
	source folder.

* Complete the `recursive` method so that it returns the
	*n*<SUP>th</SUP> fibonacci number using the recursive proram
	from <a href="studio.html">studio</a>.

* Complete the `iterative` method so that it computes the
	same function, but iteratively.

	As a hint, you will need two variables that represent the 
	*(n-1)*<SUP>th</SUP> and
	*(n-2)*<SUP>th</SUP> values of the sequence.  Adding those together
	produces the
	*n*<SUP>th</SUP> term.  The variables\' values are then shifted prior
	to the next iteration.

* Run the `CorrectnessTest` to make sure your functions are
	computing the correct values.

* We will now compare the timing of the two methods.
	First run `TimedTest`, and give it a little time to finish. Right click the `outputs` folder and click refresh. You should now see two excel file outputs in the folder. Open them up and plot the points, observing the difference in time between the iterative and recursive methods.
