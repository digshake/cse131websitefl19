# Description

In this assignment you create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine" target = "new">slot machine</a>. 
In this game, you pull a lever which causes three or more shapes to appear randomly. Based on the combination of the 
shapes and their colors, the player wins a certain amount of money. You will create this machine using Sedgewick\'s 
`StdDraw`. 

## Procedure

Be creative! Many implementations will satisfy the requirements.

Your slot machine must include:

* A method for drawing the slot machine. Most slot machines have between 3 and 7 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine#Reels" 
	target = "new">reels</a>.

* A method for randomly picking shapes and their colors and displaying them. It is up to you to decide how many different shapes 
	and colors and which ones to use.

* A way to reward multiple win conditions for when all the colors are the same, all the 
	shapes are the same, and both the colors and shapes are the same. 

* A way to show the balance that the player has in the machine. Each pull of the lever should cost a certain amount of money (that is 
less than the win amounts).
