The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball">Magic Eight Ball</a>
is an autoresolution device. A question of `boolean` type is
posed, the Magic Eight Ball is turned over, and it then displays its advice
in a murky window.  It has resurfaced in other guises over the ages, most
recently perhaps as <a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Conch_Shell"> The Magic Conch Shell</a> in the
<a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Club_SpongeBob">Club SpongeBob</a>
episode of 
<a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com"> SpongeBob SquarePants</a>.

To receive credit for this extension, your implementation of the
Magic 8 Ball must:

* Repeatedly prompt the user for his or her question using `ArgsProcessor`.

* Dramatically cause the answer to emerge in a (`StdDraw`)
display, over a 2-5 second period, as follows:

	* Display the result in a triangular shape, such as shown
	<a href="http://www.indra.com/cgi-bin/spikes-8-ball"> here</a>. (Your solution
	will be much more dramatic as you include the following.)  Your triangle
	need not rotate.
	
	* Your rendering must fade the image from black to showing the
	triangle with text in a continuous manner, as the answer emerges.
	
	* Your rendering of the answer must cause the text go from blurry to
	sharp as the answer emerges.
	
	* Try to have a suitably eerie sound accompany your display. (not necessary
	for credit, but nice)
