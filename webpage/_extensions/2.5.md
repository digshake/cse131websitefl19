[Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_(franchise)){:target="_blank"}, created in 1981 by Nintendo, is a classic video game 
starring the fictional Italian character Mario. In the assignment, 
loops printing hashtags will be used to build the block mountains as seen in the picture.

The code for this assignment will be unit-tested, which means that we have an automatic way to determine if your code is producing the correct output. For the unit testing to work, you must follow the instructions below carefully.

* Find and open the Java class Mario in the mario package of your extensions folder.
* Your program must frist prompt the user for two integer inputs using ArgsProcessor. These must be requested in the following order:

	<b>size</b>
	
	What is the size of the mountain? In the picture above, the mountain has size 5 because there are 5 levels of squares, and the widest part of the mountain, at its bottom, is also 5 squares. A mountain will always be a square structure containing size√ósize elements, some of which are hashtags (#) and some of which are blanks.
	
	<b>pattern</b>
	
	We will use an integer in the range 1 to 4 to indicate which pattern your program should produce. In the picture above, pattern 1 is shown. The other patterns are explained below

* Your program then prints the mountain of the specified size and pattern.

1. Mario runs from left to right. Create a mountain that he would have to climb, as shown in the example for a size 5 mountain.

	<pre>
			#
		   ##
		  ###
		 ####
		#####
	</pre>

2. Create a mountain that he would descend, as shown below for a size 3 mountain.

	<pre>     
		#  
		## 
		###
	</pre>

3. Make a mountain that resembles pattern 1, but flipped upside-down. Below is shown a size 7 mountain for this pattern.


	<pre>
	  #######
	   ######
		#####
		 ####
		  ###
		   ##
			#
	</pre>		

4. Make a mountain that resembles pattern 2, but flipped upside down. Below is shown a size 4 mountain for this pattern.
	
	<pre>
		#### 
		###  
		##   
		#  
	</pre>

Try running your Mario class and test yourself using various sizes (say, 1 to 10) and patterns (always an integer from 1 to 4).

Run the unit test by right (control) clicking on MarioTest and running it as you would any other program.  Note that the unit test are very sensitive to [whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character){:target="_blank"} which are the characters like tab, space, and newlines that don't show anything in the foreground color.  On a white background whitespace characters don't have a visible impact, but they do move the cursor to a new location. In particular:
* Avoid extra spaces at the beginning of lines
* Avoid using more `ln`s than needed.  For example, if the size is 5 there should be exactly 5 things that move to a new line (5 `println`s or 5 `\n`s or a mix of the two.)

If you see a green bar, then the test ran correctly. If it's red, you have a problem with your solution. The output shown in the console window should help you determine what is wrong.
