[Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_(franchise)), created in 1981 by Nintendo, is a classic video game 
starring the fictional Italian character Mario. In the assignment, 
loops printing hashtags will be used to build the block mountains as seen in the picture.

* Find and open the Java class Mario in the mario package of your extensions folder.
* Your program must first prompt the user for two integer inputs using `ArgsProcessor`. These must be requested in the following order:

	<b>size</b>
	
	What is the size of the mountain? In the picture above, the mountain has size 5 because there are 5 levels of squares, and the widest part of the mountain, at its bottom, is also 5 squares. A mountain will always be a square structure containing size√ósize elements, some of which are hashtags (#) and some of which are blanks.
	
	<b>pattern</b>
	
	We will use an integer in the range 1 to 4 to indicate which pattern your program should produce. In the picture above, pattern 1 is shown. The other patterns are explained below

* Your program then prints the mountain of the specified size and pattern.

1. Mario runs from left to right. Create a mountain that he would have to climb, as shown in the example for a size 5 mountain.

	<pre>
			#
		   ##
		  ###
		 ####
		#####
	</pre>

2. Create a mountain that he would descend, as shown below for a size 3 mountain.

	<pre>     
		#  
		## 
		###
	</pre>

3. Make a mountain that resembles pattern 1, but flipped upside-down. Below is shown a size 7 mountain for this pattern.


	<pre>
	  #######
	   ######
		#####
		 ####
		  ###
		   ##
			#
	</pre>		

4. Make a mountain that resembles pattern 2, but flipped upside down. Below is shown a size 4 mountain for this pattern.
	
	<pre>
		#### 
		###  
		##   
		#  
	</pre>

Try running your Mario class and test using various sizes (say, 1 to 10) and patterns (always an integer from 1 to 4).
