[Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_(franchise)), created in 1981 by Nintendo, is a classic video game 
starring the fictional Italian character Mario. In the assignment, 
loops printing hashtags will be used to build the block mountains as seen in the picture.

Create Mountain Blocks in Mario using loops. Test all your loops on mountains of various sizes.

Hint: You many want to use underscores for spacing the blocks correctly before substituting spaces.

This can be accomplished by printing each line or character separately, or by 
adding all the spaces and hashtages to one large String. Using **"\n"** in a String causes a line break.
So, for example:

`String s = "one" + "\n" + "two";`

prints out to:

`one`

`two`

1. Create a mountain that ascends to the right, as shown in the example for a size 5 mountain. 

<pre>
	    #
	   ##
	  ###
	 ####
	#####
</pre>

2. Create a mountain that descends to the right, as shown.

<pre>
	#    
	##   
	###  
	#### 
	#####
</pre>

3. Make a mountain that resembles the original mountain flipped upside down. Ex:

<pre>
    #####
     ####
      ###
       ##
    	#
</pre>		

4. Make a mountain that resembles the second one upside down. Ex:

<pre>
    #####
    #### 
    ###  
    ##   
    #  
</pre>
