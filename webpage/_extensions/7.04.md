##Procedure

###Overview

Note: This assignment can only be completed after completing the previous "Project: Matrix" extension.

You will create a `Gaussian` class in the `matrix` package. Inside of it you will have a `public Matrix getSolution()` method that solves a series of equations by Gaussian elimination as described in this <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">Wikipedia article</A>.

###Directions

1. Create a constructor in the `Gaussian` class that takes in two `Matrix`es, a `n`x`n Matrix` that represents the coefficients in the set of equations, and a `n`x1 `Matrix` that represents the constants.

2. Write a `getSolution()` method that takes an instance of a `Gaussian` object and finds and returns the solution of the system of equations that it represents. As the article describes, you must achieve this by exchanging, scaling, and adding rows until the coefficients `Matrix` is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix" target="new">the identity matrix</a>. Remember that every time you perform one of those operations, you must do it to both `Matrix`es. You will then return the updated constants `Matrix`. 
 
	HINT: try working on the bottom-left side of the `Matrix` first. Once you get it in echelon form, working on the top-right side is very similar.
 
   
	You can assume that there will only be one solution to the system of equations that we provide to you.

	NOTE: Your solution to this extension must be a general one. In other words, it cannot be restricted to solving 3x3 (or 3x4 if you count the sums column) matrices. It must be able to solve systems of equations with arbitrary numbers of parameters, provided that the length and width of the coefficients matrix equal the length of the sums matrix and the width of the sums matrix equals one.

###To Demo
You must pass the `GaussianElimination` unit test.
